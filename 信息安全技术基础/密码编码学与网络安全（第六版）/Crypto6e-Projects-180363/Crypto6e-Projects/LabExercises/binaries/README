In this folder you will find the following files:

- client: binary file of the client compiled on LINUX
- server: binary file of the server compiled on LINUX
- authserver: binary file of the Authentication Server compiled on LINUX

Following is an example of how this binaries should be executed.
1. Open a terminal
 
2. Write in the command line: ./authserver  <authserverport>  <clientID>  <clientkey>  <serverID> <serverkey>
	for example: ./authserver 9877 ALICE 0123456789abcdef BOB 40fedf386da13d57

3. Write in the command line: ./server  <server port>  <authserverkey> <input file>
	for example: ./server 9977 40fedf386da13d57 input.txt

4. On a different terminal, Write in the command line: 
	./client  <authservername> <authserverport> <authserverkey> <server name> <server port> <output file> <clientID> <serverID>
	for example: ./client msee190pcXX 9877 0123456789abcdef msee190pcXX 9977 output.txt ALICE BOB
	 Where XX is the number of the machine you are using at msee190.

These test programs have an extra feature, a DEBUG option. If DEBUG is enable, these programs will
print out to screen several information that could be useful to verify you implementation. To activate
this option, do the following:
For example, for the server (It also applies for client and authserver):
	Write in the command line: ./server 9977 40fedf386da13d57 input.txt -DDEBUG

Extra Notes:
1. This binaries only run on Linux machines (such as msee190 PCs) because of compatibility issues with 
the Openssl library that is installed on ECE Sun machines
2. Network byte order conversion has been applied to several packet fields. Therefore, when running your
test, be sure to check that you are doing the right byte order conversion.
