<CENTER>ANNOUNCING REQUEST FOR CANDIDATE ALGORITHM NOMINATIONS FOR THE ADVANCED 
ENCRYPTION STANDARD<BR>(AES)</CENTER></H2><B>AGENCY:</B> National Institute of 
Standards and Technology (NIST), Commerce. 
<P><B>ACTION:</B>&nbsp; Notice; Request for candidate encryption algorithm 
nomination packages 
<P><B>SUMMARY:</B>&nbsp; A process to develop a Federal Information Processing 
Standard (FIPS) for Advanced Encryption Standard (AES) specifying an Advanced 
Encryption Algorithm (AEA) has been initiated by the National Institute of 
Standards and Technology (NIST).&nbsp;&nbsp; This notice requests submissions of 
candidate algorithms for consideration for inclusion in the AES and specifies 
how to submit a nomination package.&nbsp; The requirements for candidate 
algorithm submission packages and minimum acceptability requirements that must 
be satisfied in order to be deemed a “complete and proper” submission are 
presented.&nbsp; The evaluation criteria which will be used to appraise the 
candidate algorithms are also described. 
<P>It is intended that the AES will specify an unclassified, publicly disclosed 
encryption algorithm available royalty-free worldwide that is capable of 
protecting sensitive government information well into the next century. 
<P>The purpose of this notice is to solicit candidate algorithms from the 
public, academic/research communities, manufacturers, voluntary standards 
organizations, and Federal, state, and local government organizations.&nbsp; 
Following the close of the submission period, NIST intends to make all 
submissions publicly available for review and comment. 
<P><B>DATES:</B> Submission deadline: candidate algorithm nomination packages 
must be received by <B>June 15, 1998</B>. 
<P>Submission packages received before <B>April 15, 1998</B> will be reviewed 
for completeness by NIST and notified of their specific deficiencies, if any, by 
<B>May 15, 1998</B>, allowing time for deficient packages to be amended by the 
submission deadline. 
<P>No amendments to deficient packages will be permitted after the submission 
deadline.&nbsp; Requests for withdrawal of candidate algorithm submission 
packages previously submitted will only be honored until the submission 
deadline. <BR>&nbsp; 
<P><B>ADDRESS:</B> Candidate algorithm submission packages should be sent to 
(Modified 6/15/98) Mr. Miles Smid, Attn: AES Nominations, NIST, Building 820,

<CENTER>
<H3>&nbsp;<A name=sec1></A>1.&nbsp; BACKGROUND</H3></CENTER>This work effort is 
being initiated pursuant to NIST's responsibilities under the Computer Security 
Act of 1987, the Information Technology Management Reform Act of 1996, Executive 
Order 13011, and OMB Circular A-130. 
<P>NIST recognizes that many institutions, both within and outside the Federal 
Government, have considerable investments in their current installed base of 
encryption equipment implementing the Data Encryption Algorithm, specified in 
the Data Encryption Standard (<A 
href="http://www.itl.nist.gov/div897/pubs/fip46-2.htm">DES, Federal Information 
Processing Standard 46-2</A>).&nbsp; DES was first approved in 1977 and was most 
recently reaffirmed by the Secretary in 1993, until December 1998.&nbsp; In 1993 
the following statement was included in the standard: 
<P>"At the next review (1998), the algorithm specified in this standard will be 
over twenty years old.&nbsp; NIST will consider alternatives which offer a 
higher level of security.&nbsp; One of these alternatives may be proposed as a 
replacement standard at the 1998 review." 
<P>It is NIST's view that a multi-year transition period will be necessary to 
move toward any new encryption standard and that DES will continue to be of 
sufficient strength for many applications.&nbsp; NIST will consult with all 
interested parties so that a smooth transition can be accomplished.&nbsp; NIST 
may not complete the AES selection process before the end of its 1998 DES 
Review, and an interim solution(s) may be necessary. 
<P>For interoperability and other purposes, NIST strongly desires to select a 
single block encryption algorithm to be specified in the AES with a strength 
equal to or better than that of Triple DES and significantly improved 
efficiency.&nbsp; However, if more than one suitable candidate is identified 
which provides significantly better advantages in a specific application(s), 
NIST may consider recommending more than one algorithm.&nbsp; Present resource 
constraints do not permit the development of&nbsp; a specific standard algorithm 
for 8-bit smart card implementations or a standard stream cipher.&nbsp; It is 
hoped that the block cipher selected will be suitably flexible for a wide 
variety of implementations, recognizing that it may not operate with optimal 
efficiency in each and every potential application. <BR>&nbsp;

  Acceptability Requirements</A> section of this announcement. </LI></OL>If the 
submitter believes that the algorithm has certain features deemed advantageous 
by the submitter, then these should be listed and described, along with 
supporting rationale.&nbsp; Some examples of these features might include, for 
example: throw-away tables, mathematically (rather than empirically) designed 
tables, statistical basis for inter-round mixing, variable key setup time, etc.

<H4><A name=sec2c></A>2.C&nbsp;&nbsp; Magnetic media</H4>
<H4><A name=sec2c1></A>2.C.1&nbsp; Reference Implementation</H4>A reference 
implementation shall be submitted, in order to promote the understanding of how 
the candidate algorithm may be implemented.&nbsp; This implementation shall 
consist of source code written in ANSI C;&nbsp; appropriate comments should be 
included in the code, and it should clearly map to the algorithm description 
included under <A 
href="http://csrc.nist.gov/CryptoToolkit/aes/pre-round1/aes_9709.htm#sec2b1">section 
2.B.1</A>.&nbsp; Since this implementation is intended for reference purposes, 
clarity in programming is more important than efficiency. 
<P>The reference implementation shall be capable of fully demonstrating the 
operation of the candidate algorithm.&nbsp; The reference implementation shall 
support all key- and block-size combinations specified in the <A 
href="http://csrc.nist.gov/CryptoToolkit/aes/pre-round1/aes_9709.htm#sec3">Minimum 
Acceptability Requirements</A> section of this announcement.&nbsp; Additionally, 
it must support all other key-block sizes that are claimed to be supported by 
the algorithm. 
<P>NIST will specify a cryptographic API for the ANSI C implementations, which 
will be made available at &lt;<A 
href="http://csrc.nist.gov/encryption/aes/aes_home.htm">http://csrc.nist.gov/encryption/aes/aes_home.htm</A>&gt;.&nbsp; 
All ANSI C submissions shall implement that API, so that the NIST test system 
can be compatible with all submissions. 
<P>Separate source code for implementing the required Known Answer Tests and 
Modes Tests with the reference implementation shall also be included.&nbsp; This 
code shall be able to process input specified in the format indicated by NIST 
(on the WWW site as referred to under <A 
href="http://csrc.nist.gov/CryptoToolkit/aes/pre-round1/aes_9709.htm#sec2b3">section 
2.B.3</A>) and run the required tests. 
<P>The reference implementation shall be provided on a single diskette, which 
shall be labeled with the submitter’s name, the algorithm name, and “Reference 
Implementation.” <BR>&nbsp; 
<H4><A name=sec2c2></A>2.C.2 Mathematically Optimized Implementations</H4>Two 
<I>mathematically</I> optimized implementations of the candidate algorithm shall 
be submitted, so that NIST can perform tests in two different languages in order 
to demonstrate the potential for efficient implementation.&nbsp; These two 
implementations shall be specified in ANSI C and Java programming languages: 
<BR>&nbsp; 
<OL type=i>
  <LI><B><I>ANSI C:</I></B>&nbsp; The first mathematically optimized 
  implementation shall be specified in ANSI C source code.&nbsp; NIST intends to 
  use the ANSI C compiler specified under “Round 1 Technical Analysis” to 
  compile the code and link it to the NIST test system.&nbsp; (NIST received 
  many comments that the optimized implementation should be written in C, since 
  it is a very common language.) 
  <P>NIST will specify a cryptographic API for the ANSI C implementations, which 
  will be made available at &lt;<A 
  href="http://csrc.nist.gov/encryption/aes/aes_home.htm">http://csrc.nist.gov/encryption/aes/aes_home.htm</A>&gt;.&nbsp; 
  All ANSI C submissions shall implement that API, so that the NIST test system 
  can be compatible with all submissions.&nbsp;<BR><BR></P>
  <LI><B><I>Java language specification:</I></B>&nbsp; The second mathematically 
  optimized implementation shall be specified in the Java programming language, 
  as defined by the Java Development Kit (JDK) version 1.1.&nbsp; This JDK 1.1 
  is publicly available for multiple platforms from Javasoft, at &lt;<A 
  href="http://www.nist.gov/cgi-bin/exit_nist.cgi?url=http://www.javasoft.com">http://www.nist.gov/cgi-bin/exit_nist.cgi?url=http://www.javasoft.com</A>&gt;.&nbsp; 
  NIST has selected Java as one language for the mathematically optimized 
  implementations because it will provide an accurate relative mathematical 
  efficiency measure of the different candidate algorithms, since it uses 
  machine-independent code.&nbsp; The use of one Java Virtual Machine - to test 
  all of the Java implementations submitted to NIST - is intended to eliminate 
  differences in hardware optimizations that may occur when using other 
  languages.&nbsp; It is not intended that the Java implementation will provide 
  an absolute efficiency measure of each candidate algorithm on the NIST 
  Analysis Platform. 
  <P>Submissions are required to use the cryptographic API defined by the Java 
  Cryptography Architecture (JCA) in conjunction with the Java Cryptography 
  Extension (JCE).&nbsp; An AES submitter shall create a Cryptography Package 
  Provider (CPP) that implements the submitted candidate algorithm.&nbsp; The 
  Provider class is described in the JCA (Refer to &lt;<A

for Both Mathematically Optimized Implementations</I></B> <BR>&nbsp; 
<UL>
  <LI>Both of the mathematically optimized implementations shall support key- 
  and block-size combinations specified in the <A 
  href="http://csrc.nist.gov/CryptoToolkit/aes/pre-round1/aes_9709.htm#sec3">Minimum 
  Acceptability Requirements</A> section of this announcement. 
  <LI>The mathematically optimized implementations shall operate in the 
  Electronic Codebook (ECB), Cipher Block Chaining (CBC), and 1-bit Cipher 
  Feedback (1-CFB) modes for encryption and decryption.&nbsp; Other modes are 
  not required to be implemented in the software provided to NIST. 
  <LI>Separate source code for implementing the required Known Answer Tests and 
  Monte Carlo Tests with the mathematically optimized implementations shall also 
  be included.&nbsp; This code shall be able to process input specified in the 
  format indicated by NIST (on the WWW site as referred to under <A 
  href="http://csrc.nist.gov/CryptoToolkit/aes/pre-round1/aes_9709.htm#sec2b3">section 
  2.B.3</A>) and run the required tests. 
  <LI>The submitter shall provide the mathematically optimized implementations 
  on two separate diskettes, which shall be labeled with the submitter’s name, 
  the algorithm name, and “Optimized - ANSI C” or “Optimized - Java”. 
  <LI>Additionally, submitters may, at their discretion, submit revised 
  optimized implementations (for both the ANSI C and Java implementations) for 
  use in the Round 2 evaluation process, allowing additional time for 
  improvements.&nbsp; These must be received prior to the beginning of the Round 
  2 evaluation; submitters will be notified of the specific deadline as 
  appropriate.&nbsp; Note that the mathematically optimized implementations on 
  file with NIST at the close of the initial submission period will be the ones 
  used in the Round 1 evaluation. </LI></UL>&nbsp; 
<H4><A name=sec2c3></A>2.C.3 Test Values - Known Answer Tests and Monte Carlo 
Tests</H4>The files on this diskette shall contain all of the test values 
required under <A 
href="http://csrc.nist.gov/CryptoToolkit/aes/pre-round1/aes_9709.htm#sec2b3">section 
2.B.3</A> of this announcement.&nbsp; That section includes descriptions of the 
required tests as well as a list of the values that must be provided.&nbsp; 
These files may be compressed using PKZIP or GNUZIP to conserve disk space, if 
necessary. 
<P>The required format for the test vectors will be specified by NIST at &lt;<A

Answer Tests and Monte Carlo Tests.” <BR>&nbsp; 
<H4><A name=sec2c4></A>2.C.4 Supporting Documentation</H4>So as to facilitate 
electronic distribution of submissions to all interested parties, <I>copies of 
all written materials must also be submitted in electronic form <B>in either 
PostScript or Adobe PDF</B></I>.&nbsp; <I>PDF is preferable</I>. (NIST will 
convert PostScript submissions to PDF.)&nbsp; Submitters planning to create PDF 
are encouraged to use the thumbnail and bookmark features, to have a clickable 
table of contents (if applicable), and to include other links within the PDF as 
appropriate. To create a PostScript file, users of PC word processors should 
configure their software to print using a PostScript printer driver, and capture 
the output using the “print to file” feature, preferably using standard 
PostScript printer fonts (not downloaded fonts). 
<P>Users of TeX, LaTeX/DVIPS should use PostScript Type 1 fonts, preferably 
standard PostScript printer fonts, rather than the default embedded bitmapped 
Computer Modern fonts.&nbsp;&nbsp; Instructions for configuring DVIPS can be 
found at <BR>&nbsp; &lt;<A

<P>This electronic version of the supporting documentation shall be provided on 
diskette(s), which shall be labeled with the submitter’s name, the algorithm

<P>All magnetic media presented to NIST shall be free of viruses or other 
malicious code.&nbsp; Media submitted will be scanned for the presence of such 
code.&nbsp; If such malicious code is found, NIST will notify the submitter and 
ask that a clean version of the magnetic media be re-submitted. 
<P>All magnetic media shall be submitted on 3.5" 1.44MB floppy diskettes, 
formatted for use on an IBM-compatible PC. 
<P>A file labeled “README” shall be included on each diskette, listing all files 
included on the diskette, with a brief description of each. 
<P>NIST is in the process of defining a selected set of cryptographic service 
calls for the ANSI C implementations.&nbsp; For the Java implementation, NIST 
will use calls from the Java Cryptography Architecture API.&nbsp; These two sets 
of calls shall be used by the NIST test software to make appropriate calls to 
the optimized and reference implementations, so that the test software does not 
have to be rewritten for each submitted algorithm.&nbsp; Therefore, <B><I>both 
the mathematically optimized and reference implementations are required to 
conform with these specific calls</I></B>.&nbsp; The implementations shall be 
supplied in source code so that NIST can compile and link them appropriately 
with the test software.&nbsp; The two selected sets of required calls will be 
available at the following location: &lt;<A

of this notice. <BR>&nbsp; 
<H4><A name=sec2d></A>2.D&nbsp;&nbsp; Intellectual Property Statements / 
Agreements / Disclosures</H4>After review of the public comments on the draft 
minimum acceptability requirements and evaluation criteria (published for 
comment in the Federal Register on January 2, 1997), NIST has determined that 
potential users of the AES desire to have the AES available worldwide on a 
royalty free basis.&nbsp; Additionally, based upon the results of the April 15, 
1997 public workshop held on the draft evaluation criteria and submission 
requirements, NIST believes there is a reasonable basis to expect a sufficient 
number and variety of&nbsp; submissions willing to meet these licensing 
conditions such that the expressed needs of potential AES users can be 
accommodated.

welcomes both domestic and international submissions; however, in order to 
facilitate analysis and evaluation, it is required that the submission packages 
be in English.&nbsp; This information includes the cover sheet, algorithm 
specification and supporting documentation, source code, and intellectual 
property information.&nbsp; Any required information that is submitted in a 
language other than English shall render the submission package 
“incomplete.”&nbsp; Optional supporting materials (e.g., journal articles) in 
another language may be submitted. 
<P>Classified and/or proprietary submissions shall not be accepted. <BR>&nbsp; 
<CENTER>
<H3><A name=sec3></A>3.&nbsp; MINIMUM ACCEPTABILITY 
REQUIREMENTS</H3></CENTER>Those packages which are deemed to be “complete” will 
then be evaluated to see if they contain a “proper” candidate algorithm.&nbsp; 
To be considered as a “proper” candidate algorithm submission (and continue 
further in the AES Development Process), candidate algorithms must meet the 
following minimum acceptability requirements: 
<OL>
  <LI>The algorithm must implement symmetric (secret) key cryptography. 
  <LI>The algorithm must be a block cipher. 
  <LI>The candidate algorithm shall be capable of supporting <I>key-block 
  combinations with sizes of <B>128-128</B>, <B>192-128</B>, and <B>256-128</B> 
  bits</I>.&nbsp; A submitted algorithm may support other key-block sizes and 
  combinations, and such features will be taken into consideration during 
  analysis and evaluation. </LI></OL>(End of minimum acceptability requirements) 
<P>Candidate algorithm submission packages which are complete (as defined 
earlier) and whose algorithm meets the minimum acceptability requirements (as 
defined immediately above) will be deemed to be “complete and proper” 
submissions.&nbsp; Those deemed otherwise will receive no further 
consideration.&nbsp; A complete list of submissions will be publicly announced 
by NIST - those which are “complete and proper,” and any others. <BR>&nbsp; 
<CENTER>
<H3><A name=sec4></A>4.&nbsp; EVALUATION CRITERIA</H3></CENTER>In order to 
provide a basis for the analysis and evaluation of encryption algorithms 
submitted to be considered for incorporation into the FIPS for AES, evaluation 
criteria will be used to review candidate algorithms.&nbsp; All of NIST’s 
analysis results will be made publicly available. 
<P>Although NIST will be performing its own analyses of the candidate 
algorithms, NIST strongly encourages public evaluation, making those results 
publicly available and submitting them to NIST.&nbsp; This information may be 
addressed at the Second and Third AES Candidate Conferences.&nbsp; NIST will 
take into account its own analysis, as well as all other input received, in 
order to make its decision regarding the AES selection. 
<P>Candidate algorithms with submission packages deemed to be “complete and 
proper” will&nbsp; be compared based on the following factors (ranked in the 
order of relative importance): <BR>&nbsp; 
<P><A name=sec4security></A><I><B>SECURITY </B>(i.e., the effort required to 
cryptanalyze):</I> 
<P>The security provided by an algorithm is the most important factor in the 
evaluation. 
<P>Algorithms will be judged on the following factors: 
<OL type=i>
  <LI>Actual security of the algorithm compared to other submitted algorithms 
  (at the same key and block size). 
  <LI>The extent to which the algorithm output is indistinguishable from a 
  random permutation on the input block. 
  <LI>Soundness of the mathematical basis for the algorithm’s security. 
  <LI>Other security factors raised by the public during the evaluation process, 
  including any attacks which demonstrate that the actual security of the 
  algorithm is less than the strength claimed by the submitter. </LI></OL>Claimed 
attacks will be evaluated for practicality. <BR>&nbsp; <BR>&nbsp; <BR><A

  <LI><I>Licensing requirements:</I> NIST intends that when the AES is issued, 
  the algorithm(s) specified in the AES shall be available on a worldwide, 
  non-exclusive, royalty-free basis.<BR><BR>
  <LI><I>Computational efficiency:</I>&nbsp; The evaluation of computational 
  efficiency will be applicable to both hardware and software 
  implementations.&nbsp; Round 1 analysis by NIST will focus primarily on 
  software implementations and specifically on one key-block size combination 
  (128-128); more attention will be paid to hardware implementations and other 
  supported key-block size combinations (particularly those required in the <A 
  href="http://csrc.nist.gov/CryptoToolkit/aes/pre-round1/aes_9709.htm#sec3">Minimum 
  Acceptability Requirements</A> section) during Round 2 analysis. 
  <P>Computational efficiency essentially refers to the speed of the 
  algorithm.&nbsp; NIST’s analysis of computational efficiency will be made 
  using each submission’s mathematically optimized implementations on the 
  platform specified under <A 
  href="http://csrc.nist.gov/CryptoToolkit/aes/pre-round1/aes_9709.htm#sec6b">Round 
  1 Technical Evaluation</A> below.&nbsp; Public comments on each algorithm’s

  taken into consideration by NIST.&nbsp;<BR><BR></P>
  <LI><I>Memory requirements:</I>&nbsp; The memory required to implement a 
  candidate algorithm - for both hardware and software implementations of the 
  algorithm - will also be considered during the evaluation process.&nbsp; Round 
  1 analysis by NIST will focus primarily on software implementations; more 
  attention will be paid to hardware implementations during Round 2. 
  <P>Memory requirements will include such factors as gate counts for hardware 
  implementations, and code size and RAM requirements for software 
  implementations. 
  <P>Testing will be performed by NIST using the mathematically optimized 
  implementations provided in the submission package.&nbsp; Memory requirement 
  estimates (for different platforms and environments) that are included in the 
  submission package will also be taken into consideration by NIST.&nbsp; Input 
  from public evaluations of each algorithm’s memory requirements (particularly 
  for various platforms and applications) will also be taken into consideration 
  by NIST.</P></LI></OL><A name=sec4aic></A><B><I>ALGORITHM AND IMPLEMENTATION 
CHARACTERISTICS</I></B> <BR>&nbsp; 
<OL type=i>
  <LI><I>Flexibility:</I> Candidate algorithms with greater flexibility will 
  meet the needs of more users than less flexible ones, and therefore, inter 
  alia, are preferable.&nbsp; However, some extremes of functionality are of 
  little practical application (e.g., extremely short key lengths) - for those 
  cases, preference will not be given. 
  <P>&nbsp;Some examples of “flexibility” may include (but are not limited to) 
  the following: 
  <OL type=a>
    <LI>The algorithm can accommodate additional key- and block-sizes (e.g., 
    64-bit block sizes, key sizes other than those specified in the Minimum 
    Acceptability Requirements section, [e.g., keys between 128 and 256 that are 
    multiples of 32 bits, etc.]). <BR>&nbsp; 
    <LI>The algorithm can be implemented securely and efficiently in a wide 
    variety of platforms and applications (e.g., 8-bit processors, ATM networks, 
    voice &amp; satellite communications, HDTV, B-ISDN, etc.). <BR>&nbsp; 
    <LI>The algorithm can be implemented as a stream cipher, Message 
    Authentication Code (MAC) generator, pseudo-random number generator, hashing 
    algorithm, etc.<BR><BR></LI></OL>
  <LI><I>Hardware and software suitability:</I>&nbsp; A candidate algorithm 
  shall not be restrictive in the sense that it can only be implemented in 
  hardware.&nbsp; If one can also implement the algorithm efficiently in 
  firmware, then this will be an advantage in the area of flexibility.<BR><BR>
  <LI><I>Simplicity:</I> A candidate algorithm shall be judged according to 
  relative simplicity of design. </LI></OL><A name=sec5></A>
<CENTER>
<H3>5.&nbsp; INITIAL PLANNING FOR THE FIRST AES CANDIDATE 
CONFERENCE</H3></CENTER>An open public conference is being planned for the 
summer of 1998, at which the submitter of each complete and proper nomination 
package is invited to publicly discuss and explain their candidate algorithm. 
<P>Written portions of all submitted candidates will be made available at the 
Conference, including those not deemed “complete and proper.” Submitters of 
complete and proper submissions will be invited to speak to discuss their 
submission and answer questions. 
<P>As details and registration procedures are finalized, they will be posted to

<CENTER>
<H3><A name=sec6></A>6.&nbsp; PLANS FOR CANDIDATE EVALUATION 
PROCESS</H3></CENTER>This section provides an overview of the envisioned AES 
candidate review process, including NIST’s plans for technical analysis of 
submissions. <BR>&nbsp; 
<H4><A name=sec6a></A>6.A&nbsp; Overview</H4>Following the close of the call for 
candidate algorithm submission packages, NIST will review them to determine 
which are “complete and proper,” as described elsewhere in this notice.&nbsp; 
NIST then intends to make all submissions publicly available (consistent with 
U.S. export regulations) and invite public comments on the “complete and proper” 
submissions.&nbsp; To help better inform the public, the First AES Candidate 
Conference will be held at the start of the public comment process to allow 
submitters to publicly explain and answer questions regarding their submissions. 
NIST intends to publish a separate Federal Register notice in the future 
requesting public comments on the candidate algorithms in the Round 1 evaluation 
to be used in narrowing of the candidate pool for more careful study and 
analysis in Round 2. 
<P>During the Round 1 public review, NIST intends to technically evaluate the 
candidate algorithms as outlined in the <A 
href="http://csrc.nist.gov/CryptoToolkit/aes/pre-round1/aes_9709.htm#sec6b">Round 
1 Technical Evaluation</A> section&nbsp; below.&nbsp;&nbsp; Note that NIST does 
not intend to conduct its own cryptanalysis, but, rather it will review the 
public evaluations of the candidate algorithms’ cryptographic strengths and 
weaknesses, and NIST will use these in determining if an algorithm meets the 
objectives of the AES.&nbsp; Because of&nbsp; limited resources, and also to 
avoid moving evaluation targets (i.e., modifying the submitted algorithms 
undergoing public review), NIST will <I>not</I> accept modifications to the 
submitted algorithms during Round 1. 
<P>For informational and planning purposes, near the end of the Round 1 public 
evaluation process, NIST intends to hold the Second AES Candidate Conference 
(approximately six months after the first conference; exact date to be 
scheduled.)&nbsp; Its purpose will be to publicly discuss the AEA candidate 
algorithms by NIST and others, and provide NIST with advice for narrowing the 
field of algorithms to be considered for the AEA. 
<P>NIST thereafter intends to narrow the field of candidates to no more than 
five candidate algorithms based upon its own analysis, public comment, and all 
other available information.&nbsp; It is envisioned that this narrowing will be 
done primarily on security, efficiency, and intellectual property 
considerations. 
<P>Before the start of Round 2 evaluation, submitters have the option of 
providing updated mathematically optimized implementations for use during the 
second phase of evaluation (for those algorithms remaining in the Round 2 
evaluation).&nbsp; During the course of Round 1 evaluations it is conceivable 
that some small deficiencies may be identified in even some of the most 
promising candidates.&nbsp; Therefore, for the Round 2 evaluations, small 
modifications to the submitted algorithms will be permitted for either security 
or efficiency purposes.&nbsp; Submitters may submit minor changes (no 
substantial redesigns) along with a supporting explanation/justification (see 
below) which must be received by NIST prior to the beginning of Round 2.&nbsp; 
(Submitters will be notified by NIST of the exact deadline.)&nbsp; If this 
option is exercised, new reference and mathematically optimized implementations 
and written descriptions must also be provided by the start of Round 2.&nbsp; 
This will allow public review of the modified algorithms during the entire 
course of the second evaluation. 
<P><I>Note:</I>&nbsp; All proposed changes for Round 2 must be proposed by the 
submitter; no proposed changes (to the algorithm or implementations) will be 
accepted from a third party. 
<P>After the narrowed list of candidate algorithms is officially announced, NIST 
intends that a six to nine month public review period will follow (the Round 2 
evaluation).&nbsp; During the public review, NIST intends to technically 
evaluate the candidate algorithms as outlined in the two sections below.&nbsp; 
Near the end of the public review period, NIST intends to hold the Third AES 
Candidate Conference. (The exact date is to be scheduled.) 
<P>NIST then will select the algorithm(s) for inclusion in the AES, which will 
be incorporated into a draft FIPS, which NIST intends to announce in the 
<I>Federal Register</I> for comment. 
<P>Note that this schedule for the AES development is somewhat tentative, 
depending in part upon the type, quantity, and quality of submissions.&nbsp; 
Specific conference dates and public comment periods will be announced at 
appropriate times in the future.&nbsp; Note also that as a result of comments 
received on the draft evaluation criteria and submission requirements, NIST has 
further extended the length of time for algorithm submissions and each of the 
ensuing planned public comment periods. <BR>&nbsp; 
<H4><A name=sec6b></A>6.B&nbsp; Round 1 Technical Evaluation</H4>NIST will 
invite public comments on all complete and proper submissions.&nbsp; NIST’s 
Round 1 analysis is intended, at a minimum, to be performed as follows: 
<OL type=i>
  <LI><I>Key-Block Size Combinations:</I>&nbsp; Round 1 testing by NIST will be 
  performed on the 128-bit key and 128-bit block size combination.&nbsp; (The 
  public, however, is welcome to also focus on other key- and block-size 
  combinations.) Testing of other key-block sizes may be accomplished if time 
  and resources permit. <BR>&nbsp; 
  <LI><I>Correctness check:</I>&nbsp; The Known Answer Test and Monte Carlo Test 
  values included with the submission will be used to test the correctness of 
  the reference and mathematically optimized implementations, once they are 
  compiled.&nbsp; <I>(It is more likely that NIST will perform this check of the 
  reference code - and possibly the optimized code as well - even before 
  accepting the submission package as “complete and proper.”)</I> <BR>&nbsp; 
  <LI><I>Efficiency testing:</I> Using the submitted mathematically optimized 
  implementations, NIST intends to perform various computational efficiency 
  tests for the 128-128 key-block combination, including the calculation of the 
  time required to perform: <BR>&nbsp; 
  <UL>
    <LI>Algorithm setup, 
    <LI>Key setup, 
    <LI>Key change, and 
    <LI>Encryption and decryption.<BR><BR></LI></UL>NIST may perform efficiency 
  testing on other platforms.&nbsp;<BR><BR>
  <LI><I>Other testing:</I>&nbsp; Other features of the candidate algorithms may 
  be examined by NIST. </LI></OL><A name=secplatform></A><B><I>Platform and 
Compilers</I></B> 
<P>The above tests will be performed by NIST with the following tools, at a 
minimum.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Due to limited resources, NIST has limited its own 
efficiency analysis to a single, common platform;&nbsp;&nbsp; however, NIST 
invites the public to conduct similar tests and compare results on additional 
platforms (e.g., RISC processors, 8-bit processors, Digital Signal Processors, 
dedicated CMOS, etc.). 
<OL type=i>
  <LI><I>NIST Analysis Platform:</I>&nbsp; IBM-compatible PC, with an Intel

the Round 1 Technical evaluation and the Second AES Candidate Conference, NIST 
intends to narrow the field of candidate algorithms to five or fewer, in order 
to focus the remaining efforts of both NIST and the public.&nbsp; Once again, 
NIST intends to perform its own analysis of the submissions, and make that 
information publicly available.&nbsp; NIST’s Round 2 analysis will, at a 
minimum, be performed as follows.&nbsp; <I>Note: the same platform and compilers 
from Round 1 will be used for the Round 2.</I> 
<OL type=i>
  <LI><I>Key-Block Size Combinations:</I>&nbsp; Round 2 testing by NIST will be 
  performed on the minimum key-block combinations specified in the <A 
  href="http://csrc.nist.gov/CryptoToolkit/aes/pre-round1/aes_9709.htm#sec3">Minimum 
  Acceptability Requirements</A> (beyond the 128-128 key-block combination that 
  was evaluated in Round 1).&nbsp; <I>Note: If the submitter chose to submit 
  updated mathematically optimized implementations prior to the beginning of 
  Round 2, then some of the tests performed in Round 1 for the 128-128 
  combination may be performed again using the new mathematically optimized 
  implementations.&nbsp; This will be done to obtain updated measurements.</I> 
  <BR>&nbsp; 
  <LI><I>Efficiency testing:</I> Using the submitted mathematically optimized 
  implementations, NIST intends to perform various computational efficiency 
  tests for the minimum key-block combinations specified in the <A 
  href="http://csrc.nist.gov/CryptoToolkit/aes/pre-round1/aes_9709.htm#sec3">Minimum 
  Acceptability Requirements</A>, including the calculation of the time required

  regarding the efficiency of the candidate algorithms when implemented in 
  hardware.&nbsp; NIST may pursue having the remaining algorithms specified 
  using a Hardware Description Language, to compare the estimated hardware 
  efficiency of the candidate algorithms. 
  <P>NIST may perform efficiency testing using additional platforms.&nbsp; Once 
  again, NIST welcomes public input regarding efficiency testing on additional 
  platforms.&nbsp;<BR><BR></P>
  <LI><I>Other testing:</I>&nbsp; Other features of the candidate algorithms may 
  be examined by NIST. If appropriate, analyses from the Second AES Candidate 
  Conference and the public evaluation during Round 1 may warrant the testing of 
  specific features. <BR>&nbsp;</LI></OL>&nbsp; 
<CENTER>
<H3><A name=sec7></A>7.&nbsp; MISCELLANEOUS</H3></CENTER>This section is 
intended to address some of the questions/comments raised in the review of the 
draft evaluation criteria. <BR>&nbsp; 
<UL>
  <LI>When evaluating algorithms, NIST will make every effort to obtain public 
  input and will encourage review of the candidate algorithms by outside 
  organizations; however, the final decision as to which algorithm(s) will be 
  proposed to the Secretary of Commerce for inclusion in the AES is the 
  responsibility of NIST.<BR><BR>
  <LI>NIST intends to develop a validation program for AES conformance testing, 
  with the goal of having it operational concurrently with the effective date of 
  the AES.<BR><BR>
  <LI>NIST does NOT have a fixed timetable for completion of the AES.<BR><BR>
  <LI>NIST is not specifically seeking a stream cipher algorithm, since any 
  block cipher algorithm can be operated in a stream cipher mode.<BR><BR>
  <LI>NIST does not intend to select a wholly distinct algorithm for each of the 
  minimum required key-block combinations.&nbsp; It is strongly recommended that 
  no submission be so constructed.<BR><BR>
  <LI>NIST does not wish to target a specific application or platform for 
  implementing the AES, as the evaluation of candidate algorithms takes 
  place.&nbsp; However, one factor that is being taken into consideration for 
  each candidate algorithm is its flexibility - the ability to implement the 
  algorithm securely and efficiently in a wide variety of platforms and 
  applications (see <A 
  href="http://csrc.nist.gov/CryptoToolkit/aes/pre-round1/aes_9709.htm#sec4aic">Algorithm 
  and Implementation Characteristics</A> under <A 
  href="http://csrc.nist.gov/CryptoToolkit/aes/pre-round1/aes_9709.htm#sec4">Evaluation 
  Criteria</A> section).<BR><BR>
  <LI>NIST does not intend to select a “backup” AES algorithm.&nbsp; Rather, 
  should the circumstances arise (e.g., discovery of a significant security 
  flaw) which could not be satisfactorily addressed by modifying the AES, NIST 
  would likely look to the other AES candidate finalists.&nbsp; Additionally, if 
  a significant period of time has elapsed since the AES selection, it would 
  also make sense to examine other algorithms which may have been developed in 
  the intervening period.<BR><BR>
  <LI>Exportability decisions regarding submissions and, eventually, products 
  implementing AES will be made by the appropriate government regulatory 
  authorities.&nbsp; NIST is a non-regulatory agency of the U.S. Department of 
  Commerce.<BR><BR>
  <LI>NIST does not intend to offer financial incentives (e.g., contests) for 
  cryptanalysis of AES candidates.<BR><BR>
  <LI>Should no appropriate algorithms be submitted in response to this call, 
  NIST expressly reserves the right to cease this process and examine other 
  possible courses of action.<BR><BR>
  <LI>Submitters are strongly encouraged to submit only one algorithm each 
  (presumably the one in which the submitter has the greatest confidence).&nbsp; 
  Submission of similar, yet distinct, algorithms may delay the public 
  evaluation process and may well raise public questions as to the submitter’s 
  level of confidence in his/her candidates.<BR><BR>
  <LI>For conference and resource allocation planning purposes, it would be 
  appreciated if those planning to submit candidates could notify the 
  individuals listed in the <A 
  href="http://csrc.nist.gov/CryptoToolkit/aes/pre-round1/aes_9709.htm#secffi">For 
  Further Information</A> section as soon as possible. 
</LI></UL><B><I>Appreciation</I></B> 
<P>NIST extends its appreciation to all submitters and those providing public 
comments during the AES development process. <BR>&nbsp; <BR>&nbsp; <BR>&nbsp;
