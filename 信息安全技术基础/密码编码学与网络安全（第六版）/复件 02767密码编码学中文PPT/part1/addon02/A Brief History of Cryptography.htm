      <P><SMALL><FONT face=Verdana>Cryptography, the science of encrypting and 
      decrypting information, dates as far back as 1900 BC when a scribe in 
      Egypt first used a derivation of the standard hieroglyphics of the day to 
      communicate. Carl Ellison, <B>Cryptography 
      Timeline</B></A>.</FONT></SMALL></P>
      <P><SMALL><FONT face=Verdana>There are many notable personalities who 
      participated in the evolution of Cryptography.&nbsp; For example, “Julius 
      Caesar (100-44 BC) used a simple substitution with the normal alphabet 
      (just shifting the letters a fixed amount) in government communications”, 
      and later, Sir Francis Bacon in 1623, who "described a cipher which now 
      bears his name -- a biliteral cipher, known today as a 5-bit binary 
      encoding.&nbsp; He advanced it as a steganographic device -- by using 
      variation in type face to carry each bit of the encoding”, 
      <U>Id</U>.&nbsp; Even one of our founding fathers, Thomas Jefferson, 
      invented a wheel cipher in the 1790's, which would be redeveloped as the 
      Strip Cipher, M-138-A, used by the US Navy during World War II.&nbsp; 
      <U>Id</U>.&nbsp;</FONT></SMALL> </P>
      <P><SMALL><FONT face=Verdana>For all the historical personalities involved 
      in the evolution of cryptography, it is William Frederick Friedman, 
      founder of Riverbank Laboratories, cryptanalyst for the US government, and 
      lead code-breaker of Japan’s World War II Purple Machine, who is “honored 
      as the father of US cryptanalysis”. &nbsp; Ellison, <U>supra</U>.&nbsp; In 
      1918 Friedman authored The Index of Coincidence and Its Applications in 
      Cryptography, which is still considered by many in this field as the 
      premiere work on cryptograph written this century.&nbsp; (Bruce Schneier, 
      Forward to <U>Applied Cryptography</U> xv (Whitfield Diffie, John Wiley 
      &amp; Sons, Inc. 1996) (2nd ed. 1996).&nbsp;</FONT></SMALL> </P>
      <P><SMALL><FONT face=Verdana>During the late 1920s and into the early 
      1930s, the US Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) established an office 
      designed to deal with the increasing use of cryptography by 
      criminals.&nbsp; Ellison, <U>supra</U>.&nbsp; At that time the criminal 
      threat involved the importation of liquor.&nbsp; <U>Id</U>. According to a 
      report written in the mid-1930s by Mrs. Elizabeth Friedman, a cryptanalyst 
      employed by the US government like her husband, William F. Friedman, the 
      cryptography employed by bootleggers… "’are of a complexity never even 
      attempted by any government for its most secret communications…. At no 
      time during the World War, when secret methods of communication reached 
      their highest development, were there used such involved ramifications as 
      are to be found in some of the correspondence of West Coast rum running 
      vessels.’"&nbsp; <U>Id</U>.</FONT></SMALL></P>
      <P><SMALL><FONT face=Verdana>Although cryptography was employed during 
      World War I, two of the more notable machines were employed during World 
      War II: the Germans’ Enigma machine, developed by Arthur Scherbius, and 
      the Japanese Purple Machine, developed using techniques first discovered 
      by Herbert O. Yardley.&nbsp; <U>Id</U>.</FONT></SMALL></P>
      <P><SMALL><FONT face=Verdana>In the 1970s, Dr. Horst Feistel established 
      the precursor to today’s Data Encryption Standard (DES) with his ‘family’ 
      of ciphers, the ‘Feistel ciphers’, while working at IBM’s Watson Research 
      Laboratory. <U>Id</U>.&nbsp; In 1976, The National Security Agency (NSA) 
      worked with the Feistel ciphers to establish FIPS PUB-46, known today as 
      DES. Ellison, <U>supra</U>.&nbsp;&nbsp; Today, triple-DES is the security 
      standard used by U.S. financial institututions.&nbsp; Adam Back, "<B>Why 
      Crypto Software is Illegal to Export from the U.S.</B></A>", 1998.&nbsp; 
      Also in 1976, two contemporaries of Feistel, Whitfield Diffie and Martin 
      Hellman first introduced the idea of public key cryptography in a 
      publication entitled "New Directions in Cryptography". Ellison,&nbsp; 
      <U>supra</U>.&nbsp; Public key cryptography is what PGP, today's industry 
      standard, uses in its software.</FONT></SMALL></P>
      <P><SMALL><FONT face=Verdana>In the September, 1977 issue of <U>The 
      Scientific American</U>, Ronald L. Rivest, Adi Shamir and Leonard M. 
      Adleman introduced to the world their RSA cipher, applicable to public key 
      cryptography and digital signatures. Ellison, <U>supra</U>. The authors 
      offered to send their full report to anyone who sent them self-addressed 
      stamped envelopes, and the ensuing international response was so 
      overwhelming the NSA balked at the idea of such widespread distribution of 
      cryptography source code. <U>Id</U>. When no response was made by the NSA 
      as to the “legal&nbsp; basis of their request”, distribution recommenced, 
      and the algorithm was published in <U>The Communications of the ACM</U> 
      the following year.&nbsp; <U>Id</U>.&nbsp; Today, one may access <A 
      href="http://www.rsa.com/"><B>RSA Laboratories Site</B></A>, to learn more 
      about the RSA algorithm and its applications.</FONT></SMALL></P>
      <P><SMALL><FONT face=Verdana>In the mid-1980s ROT13 was employed by USENET 
      groups to prevent the viewing of “objectionable material [by] innocent 
      eyes”, and soon thereafter, a 1990 discovery by Xuejia Lai and James 
      Massey proposed a new, stronger, 128-bit key cipher designed to replace 
      the aging DES standard:&nbsp; IDEA.&nbsp; Adam Back, supra. Called the 
      International Data Encryption Algorithm, IDEA, this algorithm was designed 
      to work more efficiently with “general purpose” computers used by everyday 
      households and businesses. &nbsp; Ellison, 
<U>supra</U>.</FONT></SMALL></P>
      <P><SMALL><FONT face=Verdana>Concerned by the proliferation of 
      cryptography, the FBI renewed its effort to gain access to plaintext 
      messages of US citizens. &nbsp;Ellison, <U>supra</U>.&nbsp; In response, 
      Phil Zimmerman released his first version of Pretty Good Privacy (PGP) in 
      1991 as a freeware product, which uses the IDEA algorithm.&nbsp; 
      <U>Id</U>.&nbsp; PGP, a free program providing military-grade algorithms 
      to the internet community, has evolved into a cryptographic standard 
      because of such widespread use.&nbsp; Ellison, 
      <U>supra</U>.</FONT></SMALL></P>
      <P><SMALL><FONT face=Verdana>The initial versions of PGP were geared 
      towards the more computer literate individual, but to the individual 
      nonetheless.&nbsp; Phil Zimmerman could be compared to Henry Ford in his 
      efforts to provide PGP to every home by making it free, and therefore, 
      affordable. &nbsp; Today, PGP's updated version is offered free to the 
      public.&nbsp; It can be downloaded at <A 
      href="http://www.pgp.com/products/dtop-security/default-encryption.asp"><B>PGP's 
      Freeware Page</B></A>, located at the site of <A 
      href="http://www.nai.com/"><B>Network Associates</B></A>, as PGP merged 
      with Helix, McAffee, and Network General.&nbsp; Also, for the consumer who 
      needs technical support not offered using the freeware, PGP can also be 
      purchased at a commercial site.&nbsp;</FONT></SMALL> </P>
      <P><SMALL><FONT face=Verdana>Most recently, in 1994, Professor Ron Rivest, 
      co-developer of RSA cryptography, published a new algorithm, RC5, on the 
      Internet.&nbsp; Ellison, <U>supra</U>. &nbsp; Although he claims RC5 is 
      stronger than DES, the algorithm is still relatively new. &nbsp; 
      <U>Id</U>.</FONT></SMALL> </P>
