<BODY>The object of this document is to study the issue of security on the 
Internet. This is aimed at any network administrator concerned in the security 
of his network. This report contains four main parts. First of all, a brief 
history of the Internet and its security problem will introduce the reader to 
this issue in which interest is increasing as well as the Internet. Then, the 
consequences of a lack of security in organisations will show the importance of 
this new problem. The breaches and how hackers work will be the next section. 
And finally, the ways to secure the unsecured will close this dissertation and 
stress the fact that it is very difficult to make the Internet secure. Moreover, 
a small conclusion will deal with the existing legislation about the security on 
the Internet. 
<P>This report is meant to provide some background to the subject for people 
interested in this new issue This study does not required advanced skills of 
computing, however a basic knowledge of UNIX and networking would be helpful to 
the reader. <BR>You can also read the <A

<P><B><FONT size=+2>CHAPTER 1: INTRODUCTION</FONT></B> 
<P>Experts are forecasting that by the year 2000 some 200 million users will be 
accessing the Internet world-wide and the London-based Electronic Commerce 
Association (ECA) forecasts that electronic commerce will grow by 50 percent 
annually, reaching œ100 billion by 2002, with the number of companies accessing 
the web rising from 1.3 million at the end of 1997 to 8 million by 2001. 
<P>The nature of computing has changed tremendously over the last few years. As 
computers and networks have become cheaper and more powerful, they have also 
become more ubiquitous. One unfortunate side effect of these changes is that 
computer crime has become much more common. 
<P>A brief history of the Internet and its security problems is given in the 
first chapter. It introduces the Internet to the reader. Then, chapter 2 covers 
the main issue of Internet security in organisations. Chapter 3 presents the way 
hackers work and the weak points of the Internet security. Chapter 4 describes 
the methods used to improve this security. 
<P>The research of documentation has mainly been done on the Internet. However, 
some books and computer magazines have helped me complete an exhaustive search. 
I also interviewed a security consultant to a French Internet provider who gave 
me some technical advice about the implementation of the security on a UNIX 
system. 
<P><B><FONT size=+2>CHAPTER 2: Brief history of the Internet and its security 
problems</FONT></B> 
<P>Before beginning to enter the problem of Internet security, it would be 
helpful to have an overview of the Internet. The best way to do this is to 
observe the history of the Internet. 
<UL>
  <LI>The Internet idea was conceived in the early '60s by the US department of 
  defence. The original name for the Internet was ARPANet (ARPA stands for: 
  Advanced Research Project Association). The aim of this computer network was 
  to be nuclear proof. Simple communication networks were chained point-to-point 
  with each place on the network dependant on the link before it. If one point 
  in the network was blown up, the whole network would become useless. So, 
  American scientists conceived the idea for a new kind of communication 
  network; one that was not organised point-to-point but instead was set up more 
  like a fish net. This structure could allow information to find its own path 
  through the network even if a section had been destroyed. 
  <LI>In 1969, researchers at four US university campuses create the first hosts 
  of the ARPANet connecting Stanford Research Institute, UCLA, UC Santa Barbara, 
  and the University of Utah. ARPANet is a success from the very beginning. 
  Although originally designed to allow scientists to share data and access 
  remote computers, email quickly becomes the most popular application. ARPANet 
  becomes a kind of electronic post office and a discussion place for 
  scientists. 
  <LI>In 1971, ARPANet grows to 23 computer hosts connecting universities and 
  government research centres. 
  <LI>In 1973 ARPANet becomes international with connections to University 
  College of London and the Royal Radar Establishment in Norway. 
  <LI>In 1974, the first commercial version of ARPANet appears. 
  <LI>In 1979, the first USENET newsgroup is established where users from all 
  over the world can take part in a discussion group about any subjects: 
  politics, religion, science, etc ... 
  <LI>In 1981, ARPANet has 213 hosts and a new host is added approximately every 
  20 days. The ARPANet starts to move away from its military and research roots. 

  <LI>In 1982, the word "Internet" is used for the first time. 
  <LI>In 1987, the number of Internet hosts is over 10,000. The Personal 
  Computer and network-ready servers industry boom allows companies and some 
  individuals to join the Internet. 
  <LI>By 1988, the first problem of security emerges. On November 1988, a 
  network "worm" temporarily disables about 6,000 of the 60,000 Internet hosts. 
  The CERT (Computer Emergency Response Team) was formed to serve as a focal 
  point for the computer security concerns of Internet users. The CERT charter 
  is to work with the Internet community to facilitate its response to computer 
  security events involving Internet hosts, to take proactive steps to raise the 
  community's awareness of computer security issues, and to conduct research 
  targeted at improving the security of existing systems. 
  <LI>In 1990, the name "Internet" is definitely decided upon. The number of 
  hosts exceed 300,000. The NSF (National Science Foundation) lifts the 
  restriction on commercial use of the Internet. Companies jump on the 
  opportunity to promote themselves through a new communication network. 
  <LI>In 1991, Tim Berners-Lee , a scientist of the CERN in Switzerland, writes 
  the first piece of code of the World Wide Web. This new technology combines 
  words, pictures, and sounds on Web pages. It is a new way of publishing 
  information on the Internet and is very user-friendly. The success comes very 
  quickly. The first WWW browser is created: Mosaic. PGP (Pretty Good Privacy) 
  is released by Philip Zimmerman. This program allows user to encrypt files to 
  send through the Internet. 
  <LI>In 1992, the numbers of hosts exceed 1,000,000. Traffic on the Internet 
  expands at a 341 % annual growth rate. 
  <LI>Netscape Communications Corp. is formed in 1994. This company distribute a 
  web browser and is becoming the biggest company of the Internet. Its main 
  product is its web browser, Netscape Navigator. 
  <LI>In 1995, the WWW becomes the most popular service on the net. Hong Kong 
  police disconnect all but 1 of the colony's Internet providers in search of a 
  hacker. 10,000 people are left without Net access. The JAVA and JAVAscript 
  languages are spread on the Internet and are inserted into the web browsers. 
  Authors of these languages claims they are highly secure, but several 
  university students find bugs of security in them. </LI></UL>Internet security 
becomes a real issue as there are increasing problems over the net. 
<P>Further details about the history of the Internet can be found in the Short 
History of the Internet [1] and The Roads and Crossroads of Internet's History 
[2]. 
<P><B><FONT size=+2>CHAPTER 3: Internet security issues in 
organisations</FONT></B> 
<P>As an increasing number of organisations come on the Internet, Internet 
security becomes a major issue. We are going to see, in this part, examples of 
problems that occur in organisations. 
<P><FONT size=+2>3.1 Hacked advertising</FONT> 
<P>Many organisations open a web site to have a sort of window on the Internet, 
where they can expose their products, activities, etc ... A new kind of hacking 
consists of entering the website illegally and modifying the homepages. It is 
like entering in a shop and changing the displays. In all cases, when a web site 
is attacked, the new homepage produced by hackers does not promote the activity 
of the organisation. Several examples are here to illustrate this new emerging 
problem. 
<P><FONT size=+1>3.1.1 U.S. administrations</FONT> 
<UL>
  <LI>The 29th of December 1996, a hacker pulled a prank on the US Air Force, 
  sneaking onto its Web site and replacing a page of aviation statistics with a 
  pornographic picture. As a result, the Pentagon's "DefenseLINK" Web site, 
  which includes about 80 home pages, was shut down for more than 24 hours while 
  officials ensured there were no other security breaches. [3] </LI></UL>This 
attack has spoiled the image of the U.S. Air Force, and it has shown that USAF 
is not very secure. It has also cost some money to the USAF in order to check 
the integrity of its system's files. 
<UL>
  <LI>Another recent web attack was on Wednesday, March 5 1997. The home page of 
  the National Aeronautics and Space Administration's (NASA) was hacked and the 
  contents changed. Hackers put a new homepage opposing American institutions. 
  (NASA's site: http://www.hq.nasa.gov) [4] 
  <LI>During the summer of 1996, hackers broke into the U.S. Justice 
  Department's Web site, posting swastikas and pictures of Adolf Hitler. The 
  home page content was hacked in protest of the current administration's push 
  to regulate the Internet. [5] </LI></UL>The main attacks are aimed toward 
American institutions, in which hackers see an interesting opportunity to 
discredit the U.S. government. 
<P><FONT size=+1>3.1.2 Other organisations</FONT> 
<UL>
  <LI>On February 10, 1997, and again on February 14, 1997 Portuguese hackers 
  launched a political attack on the web page of the Indonesian government, 
  focusing on that country's continued oppression of East Timor. They wanted to 
  call attention on to the necessity of self-determination and independence of 
  the people of Timor, oppressed and violated for decades by the government of 
  Indonesia. [6] 
  <LI>The Kriegsman fur site was hacked in November 1996 by an anti-fur 
  activist. The new homepage placed by hackers blamed the company that kills 
  animals for fur. [7] </LI></UL>Here we have 2 examples of a site being hacked to 
defend a cause. Hackers who broke into the sites wanted to express themselves. 
They also wanted to show what they believe to the world. 
<P><FONT size=+2>3.2 Industrial and military espionage</FONT> 
<P>Nowadays, the bulk of Internet hosts are corporate sites. Some companies use 
Internet as a network to transmit data. There are a lot of examples of 
companies' hosts being hacked. 
<P>A good example is the Boeing site: 
<P>A few years ago, two college students hacked their way into Boeing's 
computers in search of password files. The U.S. Justice Department says that 
situation is a classic case of how hackers can drive up business costs. Boeing 
was also able to ascertain that these hackers had obtained root access to the 
federal courthouse system in Seattle. After the case was over, it cost Boeing 
$57,000 simply to check the integrity of their avionics data. [8] 
<P>Actually, the main risk is the theft of confidential data, but there is 
another risk, the risk of modified data. The hacker can change the current data 
into faulty ones. Then, the organisation will work with altered data and produce 
faulty results. This is why Boeing spent so much money to check all the 
integrity of its data. 
<P>Another example: 
<P>In 1987, tracing an apparently innocuous 75-cent accounting error revealed an 
intruder who had given himself an account on the Lawrence Berkeley Lab's 
computer system. The account was traced to a West German programmer who was 
copying documents from military computers attached to the MILNET (the Internet 
segment reserved for military uses). The hacled documents were sold to the KGB. 
[9] 
<P>The Gartner Group's William Malik says that one of his clients, a large 
manufacturing company, lost a $900 million dollar bid to a competitor which had 
apparently cracked the company's computers and learned about its bid. [10] 
<P>Examples of this sort are abundant in the world of the Internet. However, a 
good number of these attacks are not reported to the public because they are 
concealed by the company or they are not detected by the network administrator 
of the firm. 
<P><FONT size=+2>3.3 Business integrity</FONT> 
<P>Credit card security is one of the biggest issue of the Internet because the 
potential to literally create a world wide commerce opens a very large hole to 
credit card fraud. 
<P>Nowadays, there are myriad virtual shops on the Internet that sell books, 
computer accessories, clothes and so forth ... All of these virtual shops use 
the credit card payment method. This means that the customer sends his credit 
card number to the virtual shop which then debits the amount of money from the 
account of the bank's credit card. But there are two problems: First, the 
transmission of the credit card number can be pick up by a third party without 
knowledge from either the merchant and the customer. Secondly, a majority of 
these commercial sites are not secure at all. Even if the transmission of the 
credit card number through the Internet is safe, the way to store it in the 
web-site is not. Credit card numbers in files inside a company's database can 
also be taken. Several firms specialising in Internet commerce have been hacked 
in search of credit card number or customers' files. 
<P>It's already happened at the Internet service provider Netcom of San Jose 
(California, USA). Kevin Mitnick, perhaps the world's most famous hacker, has 
stolen about 17,000 credit card numbers before to being caught by clever 
high-tech detectives. [11] 
<P>While commerce on the Internet is becoming a multimillion pound business, it 
is also becoming a large concern for credit card corporations and their 
customers. 
<P><FONT size=+2>3.4 System disabling</FONT> 
<P>Systems providing TCP-based services (WWW, email, newsgroup, gopher, etc ...) 
to the Internet community may be unable to provide those services while under a 
hacker's attack and for some time after the attack has ceased. The service 
itself is not harmed by the attack; usually only the ability to provide the 
service is impaired. In some cases, the system may exhaust its memory, crash, or 
be rendered otherwise inoperative. These attacks block the system temporarily, 
so during the inoperative time, the company owner of the system might lose 
money. A description of this sort of attack is in the next section. [12] 
<P><B><FONT size=+2>CHAPTER 4: Breaches and how hackers work</FONT></B> 
<P>How do hackers work ? What are the weak points of the Internet ? In this 
chapter we will see the different methods used by hackers to reach their goals 
and some of the weaknesses of networks. Of course, the study can not be 
exhaustive, but it will cover the main used methods. 
<P><FONT size=+2>4.1 Introduction</FONT> 
<P>First of all, we will learn what the definition of a "hacker" is. 
Subsequently, a short explanation about the network file system will be useful 
for the understanding of the rest of this report. 
<P><FONT size=+1>4.1.1 Definition of a hacker</FONT> 
<P>On Internet, calling someone a "hacker" is usually a statement that said 
person holds a great deal of knowledge and expertise in the field of 
computing-networking, and is someone who is capable of exercising this expertise 
with great finesse. The hacker holds the belief that system-cracking for fun and 
exploration is ethically OK as long as the person commits no theft, vandalism, 
or breach of confidentiality. A cracker is one who breaks security into other 
peoples' computer systems, for a variety of reasons. Particularly antisocial 
crackers have a vandalistic streak, and delete filestores, crash machines, and 
stop running processes in pursuit of their "kicks". In the "real world", various 
media people have taken the word "hacker" and coerced it into meaning the same 
as "cracker". This usage is wholly inappropriate among the Internet community. 
<P><FONT size=+1>4.1.2 Network file system</FONT> 
<P>Every time a user requests access to a file, the operating system decides 
whether that user should have access to the file in question. The system makes 
this decision based on who owns the file, who is asking for access to the file, 
and what access permissions the owner has set up. The access permissions define 
who will have access to the file. 
<P>There are two main reasons why one should care about protecting his/her files 
from other users. The first reason is that one may wish to protect the contents 
of his/her files from others. One may consider the contents of the files 
private, and does not want others to be able to read or modify the contents of 
the files. The second reason is that if others can modify the files, they can 
obtain access to your account. For example, if a malicious user has write access 
to your home directory, they can create or modify your ".rhosts" file to give 
anyone unlimited access to your account. 
<P>The main goal for an intruder is to gain root access. Root access allows a 
user to do all that he wants on a system, he can delete, modify or add new 
files. Most computer breakins where the intruder gains "root access" to a 
computer begin when the intruder breaks into a regular user's account. Once on 
the machine as a regular user, the intruder can then launch an attack to gain 
root access on a machine by using a security hole in the operating system. [13] 
<P><FONT size=+2>4.2 Social engineering</FONT> 
<P>This is a term used among cracker for cracking techniques that rely on 
weaknesses in the human being attached to a computer system rather than 
software; the aim is to trick people into revealing passwords or other 
information that compromises a target system's security. 
<P>Classic tricks include phoning up a mark who has the required information and 
posing as a field service tech or a fellow employee with an urgent access 
problem. A common variation is to do this by phone, talk or IRC (Internet Relay 
Chat). 
<P>Another classic social engineering trick is for a hacker to send email 
claiming to be a system administrator. The hacker will claim to need your 
password for some important system administration work, and ask you to email it 
to him/her. It is possible for a hacker to forge email, making it look like it 
came from somebody you know to be a legitimate system administrator. Often the 
hacker will send this message to every user on a system, hoping that one or two 
users will fall for the trick. 
<P>Another form of social engineering goes back to guessing your password. 
People who can find out things about you, can use that information to guess your 
password. For example, the names of your children, their birthdays or the 
license plate number on your car are all likely candidates for guessing as 
passwords. Hackers can go very far to guess passwords. 
<P><FONT size=+2>4.3 Password cracking</FONT> 
<P>Passwords are very important because they are the first line of defence 
against interactive attacks on a system. It can be stated simply: if a cracker 
cannot interact with a remote system, and he has no access to read or write the 
information contained in the password file, then he has almost no chance to 
mount a successful attack against the system. This is also why, if a cracker can 
at least read the password file of a remote host, it is so important that he is 
not able to break any of the passwords contained therein. If he can, then it is 
also fair to assume that he can log on to the system and can then break into 
"root" via an operating system hole. 
<P>The most common way a hacker will try to get a password is via a "dictionary 
attack". In a dictionary attack, the attacker takes a dictionary of words and 
names, and tries each one to see if it is the right password. They do this with 
programs which can guess hundreds or thousands of words per second. This makes 
it easy for them to try lots of variations: word spelled backwards, different 
capitalisations, adding a digit to the end, and so on. In addition, the hacker 
community has built large dictionaries which are designed to "crack" passwords. 
Using words from foreign languages, or names of things, people or towns is no 
protection against current password crackers. The most famous program of 
passwords cracking is "Crack4.1" with its general 50,000-word dictionary. 
<P><FONT size=+2>4.4 Packet and password sniffing</FONT> 
<P>If a hacker can not guess your password, there are other ways he/she can try 
to get it. One way which has become very popular is called "password sniffing". 
It turns out that most networks use what is known as "broadcast" technology. 
What that means is that every message that a computer on the network transmits 
can be read by any other computer on that network. In practice, all the 
computers except the recipient of the message will notice that the message is 
not meant for them, and ignore it. However, many computers can be programmed to 
look at every message on the network. If one does this, one can look at message 
which are not intended for him/her. 
<P>Hackers have programs which do this, and then scan all the messages which 
traverse a network looking for passwords. If someone logs in to a computer 
across a network, and some other computer on the network has been compromised 
this way, the person may unwittingly give his/her password to the attacker. This 
is a serious threat to users who login to computers from remote sites. If 
someone logs in on the console of a computer, his/her password never crosses a 
network where it can be sniffed. But if someone logs in from some other network 
or from an Internet service provider, he/she is dependent on the security of 
these networks. The well known programs of password sniffing are: <BR>- Esniff.c 
(Source for a basic ethernet sniffer) <BR>- Solaris Sniffer (A more powerful 
version of E-Sniff modified for Solaris 2) <BR>- TCPDump 
<P><FONT size=+2>4.5 IP spoofing</FONT> 
<P>The IP address of a host is presumed to be valid and is therefore trusted by 
TCP and UDP services. A problem is that, using IP source routing, an attacker's 
host can masquerade as a trusted host or client. Briefly, IP source routing is 
an option that can be used to specify a direct route to a destination and return 
path back to the origination. The route can involve the use of other routers or 
hosts that normally would not be used to forward packets to the destination. An 
example of how this can be used such that an attacker's system could masquerade 
as the trusted client of a particular server is as follows: 
<UL>
  <LI>The attacker would change his host's IP address to match that of the 
  trusted client, 
  <LI>The attacker would then construct a source route to the server that 
  specifies the direct path the IP packets should take to the server and should 
  take from the server back to the attacker's host, using the trusted client as 
  the last hop in the route to the server, 
  <LI>The attacker sends a client request to the server using the source route, 
  <LI>The server accepts the client request as if it came directly from the 
  trusted client and returns a reply to the trusted client, 
  <LI>The trusted client, using the source route, forwards the packet on to the 
  attacker's host. </LI></UL>Many UNIX hosts accept source routed packets and will 
pass them on as the source route indicates. Many routers will accept source 
routed packets as well, whereas some routers can be configured to block source 
routed packets. 
<P>An even simpler method for spoofing a client is to wait until the client 
system is turned off and then impersonate the client's system. In many 
organisations, staff members use personal computers and TCP/IP network software 
to connect to and utilise UNIX hosts as a local area network server. The 
personal computers often use NFS to obtain access to server directories and 
files (NFS uses IP addresses only to authenticate clients). An attacker could, 
after hours, configure a personal computer with the same name and IP address as 
another's, and then initiate connections to the UNIX host as if it were the 
"real" client. This is very simple to accomplish and likely would be an insider 
attack. 
<P>Electronic mail on the Internet is also particularly easy to spoof and, 
without enhancements such as digital signatures, generally can not be trusted. 
As a brief example, consider the exchange that takes place when Internet hosts 
exchange mail. The exchange takes place using a simple protocol consisting of 
ASCII-character commands. An intruder easily could enter these commands by hand 
by using TELNET to connect directly to a system's Simple Mail Transfer Protocol 
(SMTP) port (port 25 on UNIX systems). The receiving host trusts that the 
sending host is who it says it is, thus the origin of the mail can be spoofed 
easily by entering a sender address that is different from the true address. As 
a result, any user, without privileges, can falsify or spoof e-mail. 
<P>Other services, such as Domain Name Service, can be spoofed, but with more 
difficulty than electronic mail. These services still represent a threat that 
needs to be considered when using them. [14] 
<P><FONT size=+2>4.6 Trojan Horses</FONT> 
<P>A Trojan horse is a program which hides itself in another apparently benign 
program. When the victim runs the apparently benign program he or she also ends 
up running the hidden Trojan program. 
<P>There are examples of UNIX Trojan horse programs on the Internet. For example 
in one incident, a well known anonymous ftp archive was broken into. The 
attackers modified a popular program available from this site, allowing them to 
break into computers which subsequently down-loaded and installed this program. 
<P><FONT size=+2>4.7 Worms</FONT> 
<P>A worm is an autonomous agent capable of propagating itself without the use 
of another program or any action by a person. The most famous worm attack 
occurred in November 1988, when a student launched a program on the Internet 
which was able to develop itself through the hosts network. Within 8 hours 
between 2 and 3 thousand computers were infested. Computers began to shut down 
because worm programs reappeared over network connections faster than they could 
be deleted. 
<P>What exactly did the worm do? The worm infested only computers running one 
particular UNIX operating system. Each worm began by creating a list of remote 
target machines from information found in the current host. 
<P>In parallel the worm would: 
<UL>
  <LI>Attempt to find the passwords of user accounts by trying permutations of 
  the account name checking a list of 432 passwords checking all the words in a 
  local dictionary, and 
  <LI>Attempt to enter each target by posing as a user (after cracking the 
  user's password) using a "bug" in the finger protocol and using a "trapdoor" 
  in the debug option for processing e-mail. </LI></UL>When an attack worked the 
worm sent a short bootstrap program and the commands to compile and execute it 
then broke the connection. If the bootstrap worked the new computer called back 
the parent worm within 120 seconds and files containing the full worm code was 
sent to the new computer. The parent worm issued commands to construct and start 
the worm on the new machine. The worm also contained mechanisms to limit its own 
population on a single machine and camouflage its presence. [15] 
<P>Worms attacks are rare, but it is still a method used by hackers when a new 
bug is found on an OS. This has the "advantage" of being able to hack a lot of 
sites in little time. 
<P><FONT size=+2>4.8 Trap Door or back door</FONT> 
<P>A trap door or back door is an entry point into a computer system that 
bypasses the normal security measures, a hidden software or hardware mechanism 
that permits system protection mechanisms to be circumvented. It is activated in 
some non-apparent manner. 
<P>It can be a hole in the security of a system deliberately left in place by 
designers or maintainers. The motivation for such holes is not always sinister; 
some operating systems, for example, come out of the box with privileged 
accounts intended for use by field service technicians or the vendor's 
maintenance programmers. 
<P>In 1983, Ken Thompson (one of the author of UNIX) revealed the existence of a 
back door in early UNIX versions that may have qualified as the most clever 
security hack of all time. The C compiler contained code that would recognise 
when the "login" command was being recompiled and insert some code recognising a 
password chosen by Thompson, giving him entry to the system whether or not an 
account had been created for him. Normally such a back door could be removed by 
removing it from the source code for the compiler and recompiling the compiler. 
But to recompile the compiler, you have to use the compiler. So Thompson also 
arranged that the compiler would recognise when it was compiling a version of 
itself, and insert into the recompiled compiler the code to insert into the 
recompiled `login' the code to allow Thompson entry and, of course, the code to 
recognise itself and do the whole thing again the next time around. And having 
done this once, he was then able to recompile the compiler from the original 
sources; the hack perpetuated itself invisibly, leaving the back door in place 
and active but with no trace in the sources. 
<P>Almost every time, when a hacker leaves a system, he leaves behind one or 
several backdoors to be able to come back whenever he wants. It is why when a 
system has been hacked it is safer to check all the system files or re-install 
the operating system. 
<P><FONT size=+2>4.9 TCP-SYN flooding</FONT> 
<P>When a system (called the client) attempts to establish a TCP connection to a 
system providing a service (the server), the client and server exchange a set 
sequence of messages. This connection technique applies to all TCP connections 
(telnet, Web, email, etc...) 
<P>The client system begins by sending a SYN message to the server. The server 
then acknowledges the SYN message by sending SYN-ACK message to the client. The 
client then finishes establishing the connection by responding with an ACK 
message. The connection between the client and the server is then open, and the 
service-specific data can be exchanged between the client and the server. 
<BR>Here is a view of this message flow: 
<P>Client&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Server 
<BR>------&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; ------ 
<BR>SYN--------------------&gt; <BR>&lt;--------------------SYN-ACK 
<BR>ACK--------------------&gt; <BR>Client and server can now <BR>send 
service-specific data 
<P>The potential for abuse arises at the point where the server system has sent 
an acknowledgement (SYN-ACK) back to client but has not yet received the ACK 
message. This is a half-open connection. The server has built in its system 
memory a data structure describing all pending connections. This data structure 
is of finite size, and it can be made to overflow by intentionally creating too 
many partially-open connections. 
<P>Creating half-open connections is easily accomplished with IP spoofing. The 
attacking system sends SYN messages to the victim server system; these appear to 
be legitimate but in fact reference a client system that is unable to respond to 
the SYN-ACK messages. This means that the final ACK message will never be sent 
to the victim server system. 
<P>The half-open connections data structure on the victim server system will 
eventually fill; then the system will be unable to accept any new incoming 
connections until the table is emptied out. Normally there is a time-out 
associated with a pending connection, so the half-open connections will 
eventually expire and the victim server system will recover. However, the 
attacking system can simply continue sending IP-spoofed packets requesting new 
connections faster than the victim system can expire the pending connections. 
<P>In most cases, the victim of such an attack will have difficulty in accepting 
any new incoming network connection. In these cases, the attack does not affect 
existing incoming connections nor the ability to originate outgoing network 
connections. However, in some cases, the system may exhaust memory, crash, or be 
rendered otherwise inoperative. 
<P>The location of the attacking system is obscured because the source addresses 
in the SYN packets are often implausible. When the packet arrives at the victim 
server system, there is no way to determine its true source. Since the network 
forwards packets based on destination address, the only way to validate the 
source of a packet is to use input source filtering. [16] 
<P><FONT size=+2>4.10 Conclusion</FONT> 
<P>There are also plenty of other attack methods but they are very technical for 
a non-advanced UNIX user. Here is a short list of some of them: 
<P>Sendmail attack: attack via the mail system on port 25 <BR>NIS and NFS attack 
<BR>FTP attack: attack via the ftp port (21) <BR>Telnet attack: attack via the 
telnet port (23) <BR>Rlogin and rsh attack 
<P>This is not an exhaustive list, because there are probably many attacks that 
have not been disclosed. 
<P><B><FONT size=+2>CHAPTER 5: Ways to secure the insecured</FONT></B> 
<P>In this part, we are going to see which methods can be used to improve the 
security on Internet. The two main hopes of Internet security remains in 
firewalls and encryption. 
<P><FONT size=+2>5.1 Internet firewalls</FONT> 
<P>Firewalls have been called condoms for corporate networks. They provide 
digital protection associated with the rapid growth of internetworking and 
commercialisation of the Internet. As with condoms, many people have heard of 
firewalls and some people use them. However, the number of security incidents 
arising from Internet connections strongly suggests that not enough people are 
using them properly. 
<P><FONT size=+1>5.1.1 What is a firewall ?</FONT> 
<P>A firewall is a form of access-control technology that prevents unauthorised 
access to information resources by placing a barrier between an organisation's 
network and an unsecured network (e.g. Internet). A firewall is also used to 
prevent the unauthorised export of proprietary information from a corporate 
network. In other words, a firewall functions as a gateway, controlling traffic 
in both directions. 
<P>The typical firewall is an inexpensive micro-based UNIX box kept clean of 
critical data, with a bunch of modems and public network ports on it but just 
one carefully watched connection back to the rest of the cluster. The special 
precautions may include threat monitoring or call-back. 
<P>Some firewalls permit only Email traffic through them, thereby protecting the 
network against any attacks other than attacks against the Email service. Other 
firewalls provide less strict protections, and block services that are known to 
be problems. [17] 
<P>Generally, firewalls are configured to protect against unauthenticated 
interactive logins from the "outside" world. This, more than anything, helps 
prevent vandals from logging into machines on the internal network. More 
elaborate firewalls block traffic from the outside to the inside, but permit 
users on the inside to communicate freely with the outside. The firewall can 
protect you against any type of network borne attack. 
<P>Firewalls are also important since they can provide a single "choke point" 
where security and audit can be imposed. Unlike in a situation where a computer 
system is being attacked by someone dialling in with a modem, the firewall can 
act as an effective "phone tap" and tracing tool. 
<P><IMG height=410 src="Internet security.files/firewall.gif" width=612> 
<P>Figure 5.1.1 Firewall's location 
<P><FONT size=+1>5.1.2 What can a firewall not do ?</FONT> 
<P>Firewalls can not protect against attacks that do not go through the 
firewall. Many corporations that connect to the Internet are very concerned 
about proprietary data leaking out of the company through that route. 
Unfortunately for those concerned, a magnetic tape can just as effectively be 
used to export data. Firewall policies must be realistic, and reflect the level 
of security in the entire network. For example, a site with top secret or 
classified data doesn't need a firewall at all: they shouldn't be hooking up to 
the Internet in the first place, or the systems with the really secret data 
should be isolated from the rest of the corporate network. 
<P>Firewalls can not protect very well against things like viruses. There are 
too many ways of encoding binary files for transfer over networks, and too many 
different architectures and viruses to try to search for them all. In other 
words, a firewall cannot replace security, consciousness on the part of the 
users. In general, a firewall cannot protect against a data-driven attack 
(attacks in which something is mailed or copied to an internal host where it is 
then executed). This form of attack has occurred in the past against various 
versions of Sendmail. 
<P><FONT size=+1>5.1.3 Conclusion</FONT> 
<P>There are plenty of sorts of firewalls. However the main part of them are a 
piece of software installed on the router of the company or on another host. But 
there are also hardware firewalls. It is an electronic board which is plugged 
inside the computer. There are different role for a firewall. Some are packet 
filtering router, dual-home gateway, bastion host, etc ... There is also a wide 
range of firewalls for each operating system: UNIX, Novell Netware, Windows NT, 
LINUX, and so on ... 
<P>Nowadays, firewalls are a good rampart against hackers. However, if a 
firewall is not installed properly, it could be worth than not having one due to 
a false sense of security. 
<P><FONT size=+2>5.2 Password protection and generation of safe passwords</FONT> 

<P>As the password protection is one of the main problem of Internet security, 
there are two major ways to improve the password security: Shadow password and 
generation of "secure" passwords. 
<P><FONT size=+1>5.2.1 Shadow password</FONT> 
<P>Shadow password is a system where the plaintext of the password file is 
hidden from all users except root, hopefully stopping all password cracking 
attempts at source. It provides a good degree of password file robustness. 
<P><FONT size=+1>5.2.2 Generation of secure passwords</FONT> 
<P>First, it is interesting to see how many possible passwords there are. Most 
people worried that programs like "Crack" will eventually grow in power until 
they can do a completely exhaustive search of all possible passwords, to break 
into a specific users' account (usually root). 
<P>Valid passwords are created from a set of 62 chars [A-Za-z0-9] and they can 
be made of even more characters such as #'œ$%^&amp; etc ... There are also to be 
between 5 and 8 characters long. With only the 62 common characters the size of 
the set of all valid passwords is: <BR>625+626+627+628 = 2.2E+14 <BR>A figure 
which is far too large to usefully undertake an exhaustive search with current 
technologies. Moreover, if one can use some of all the 95 non-control characters 
in passwords, this increases the search space for a cracker to cover even 
further. 
<P>Any password derived from any dictionary word (or personal information), 
modified in any way, constitutes a potentially guessable password. 
<P>For example password based on: 
<P>login name: cme45212 <BR>first name: sandra, stefan <BR>standard surname: 
smith <BR>backward words: htims, 21254emc, retupmoc <BR>words of dictionary: 
computer <BR>capitalised word: Computer, CoMpuTer <BR>words of cracking 
dictionary: PORSCHE911, 12345678, qwerty, abcxyz, mr.spoke <BR>foreign language 
words: salut45, gutentag 
<P>A good password is easy to remember, but hard to guess. The best way to make 
a password "un-crackable" is to make it appear random. Remember, it is always 
possible to insert digits and punctuation in a password. The favourite way to 
think of passwords which appear random, but which are easy to remember is to: 
<P>1.Take a phrase, or a line from a poem or a song. It needs to be at least 8 
words long <BR>2.Take the first letter from each word, and use it as a character 
in your password. <BR>3.Take advantage of punctuation. <BR>4.If you can not 
think of one that is long enough, you can use a shorter one and pad it at the 
beginning and end with digits. 
<P>For example, the phrase: "One for all, and all for one" yields the relatively 
un-crackable password: "Ofa,&amp;af1" 
<P>A good way for a network administrator to know if users have secured 
passwords is to use password cracking programs on his own system as will do a 
cracker. "Crack" is a good tool for insuring that UNIX system's users have not 
selected easily guessed passwords which appear in standard dictionaries. [18] 
<P><FONT size=+2>5.3 Encryption</FONT> 
<P>Encryption is the cryptographic methods and the technology which permits 
users to send messages that can be understood (decrypted) only by the intended 
recipient, improving controls on routing messages over the Internet, and 
improving operating system quality to decrease program flaws and other security 
vulnerabilities. 
<P>There are two main types of encryption: asymmetric encryption (also called 
public-key encryption) and symmetric encryption. 
<P><FONT size=+1>5.3.1 Asymmetric or public key encryption</FONT> 
<P>This is a cryptographic system that uses two keys: a public key known to 
everyone and a private or secret key known only to the recipient of the message. 

<P>Example: When John wants to send a secure message to Jane, he uses Jane's 
public key to encrypt the message. Jane then uses her private key to decrypt it. 

<P>An important element to the public key system is that the public and private 
keys are related in such a way that only the public key can be used to encrypt 
messages and only the corresponding private key can be used to decrypt them. 
Moreover, it is virtually impossible to deduce the private key if you know the 
public key. 
<P>Public-key systems, such as Pretty Good Privacy (PGP, see further), are 
becoming popular for transmitting information via the Internet. RSA system used 
for securing payment through the world wide web is now a standard. These systems 
are extremely secure and relatively simple to use. The only difficulty with 
public-key systems is that you need to know the recipient's public key to 
encrypt a message for him or her. However when paying through the WWW, the 
browser manages this task itself by asking the remote server its public key. 
[19] 
<P><FONT size=+1>5.3.2 Symmetric encryption</FONT> 
<P>It is a type of encryption where the same key is used to encrypt and decrypt 
the message. DES encryption (Data Encryption Standard) is the most famous form 
of symmetric encryption. It is currently used by US administrations to send data 
through a network. However, They use the public key encryption system to send 
the key of DES encryption to the recipient of the encrypted file. 
<P><FONT size=+1>5.3.3 PGP</FONT> 
<P>This is a program for encrypting messages developed by Philip Zimmerman. PGP 
is one of the most common ways to protect messages on the Internet because it is 
effective, easy to use, and free. PGP is based on the public-key method, which 
uses two keys: one is a public key that you disseminate to anyone from whom you 
want to receive a message, the other is a private key that you use to decrypt 
messages that you receive. 
<P>To encrypt a message using PGP, you need the PGP encryption package, which is 
available for free from a number of sources (the official repository is at the 
Massachusetts Institute of Technology). 
<P>PGP is such an effective encryption tool that the US government actually 
brought a lawsuit against Zimmerman for putting it in the public domain and 
hence making it available to enemies of the U.S. After a public outcry, the US 
lawsuit was dropped, but it is still illegal to use PGP in many other countries. 

<P>Encryption is the most effective way to achieve data security, ensure data 
integrity and confidentiality. 
<P><FONT size=+2>5.4 IP spoofing and SYN-flooding</FONT> 
<P>With the current IP protocol technology, it is impossible to eliminate 
IP-spoofed packets. However, there are steps to be taken to reduce the number of 
IP-spoofed packets entering and exiting the network. 
<P>The best method is to install a filtering router that restricts the input to 
the external interface (known as an input filter) by not allowing a packet 
through if it has a source address from the internal network. In addition, it 
could be good to filter outgoing packets that have a source address different 
from the internal network to prevent a source IP spoofing attack from 
originating from the internal site. 
<P>The combination of these two filters would prevent outside attackers from 
sending the site packets pretending to be from the internal network. It would 
also prevent packets originating within the internal network from pretending to 
be from outside this network. These filters will not stop all TCP SYN attacks, 
since outside attackers can spoof packets from any outside network, and internal 
attackers can still send attacks spoofing internal addresses. 
<P>IP spoofing and SYN-flooding are currently the two major unresolvable 
problems of Internet security. 
<P><FONT size=+2>5.5 Security auditing tools</FONT> 
<P>There are plenty of tools available through the Internet to check the 
security of a system. Some tools scan hosts for known vulnerabilities: SATAN is 
the most famous program, others tools check the file integrity such as Tripwire. 
The network administrator is strongly advised to use these tools before hackers. 

<P>Here is a short list of the other well known tools: ISS, C2 security, COPS, 
Tiger (part of the TAMU Security Package), MD5. [20] 
<P><FONT size=+2>5.6 Security through obscurity</FONT> 
<P>This is a way to consider that any system can be secure so long as nobody 
outside of its implementation group is allowed to find out anything about its 
internal mechanisms. The technique is hiding account, passwords in binary files 
or scripts with the presumption that "nobody will ever find it". 
<P>This is a philosophy favoured by many bureaucratic US agencies. The main 
critic of this technique maintains that it is pseudosecurity because it does not 
solve the real problems of security but instead hides them. 
<P>It can also tie the manager into trusting a small group of people for as long 
as they live. If the employees get an offer of better pay from somewhere else, 
the knowledge goes with them, whether the knowledge is replaceable or not. Once 
the secret gets out, that is the end of the security. 
<P>However, this technique can complement other security steps. 
<P><FONT size=+2>5.7 IP Restriction</FONT> 
<P>IP Restriction is a very common thing to do to limit a user to parts of the 
server. By allowing only a few IP address to other parts of the server, a hacker 
will not be granted access to areas where he or she can cause damage. [21] 
<P><FONT size=+2>5.8 Education and awareness</FONT> 
<P>One of the major threat to the security of a system is not the technical 
holes of a host computer; it is the lack of awareness. By "lack of awareness," I 
mean that Internet users are often under the impression that the only way a 
hacker can break into their account or the system is through some secret back 
door left open by careless administrators. Another misunderstanding is the 
belief that if there is nothing of value in a user's account, no one would 
bother to break in. What an intruder finds valuable about an account is access 
to the system. This single access allow the intruder to get root access via a 
hole in the operating system or can be used as a gateway to hack other sites. 
The user is then responsible for this. 
<P>- A good step is to take strict measures to make users aware of the 
importance of their password by encourage them to: <BR>changing their password 
after the first login. <BR>- not sharing their account <BR>- protecting their 
password i.e. be careful while typing the password <BR>- changing their password 
regularly, and especially after logging into the account from a remote machine. 
<BR>- choosing secure passwords 
<P>Another good way to imply users for the security is to make them sign a 
charter of responsibility and good behaviour on the Internet. 
<P>The security is the business of everybody on a system: the administrator as 
well as the users. And the role of the administrator is to educate his users to 
security. 
<P><B><FONT size=+2>CHAPTER 6: Conclusion</FONT></B> 
<P>As Internet security is a recent issue, the legislation about it is quite 
rare. The US federal networking council wrote a draft on the Internet security 
in 1995. This defines where the responsibilities of users of the Internet lie: 
the user, the management of multi-user hosts and Internet facilities, the system 
administrators, the Federal Networking Council, the Vendors and System 
Developers, the Computer Network and Service Providers. Further details about 
the US legislation can be found on the website of the US federal networking 
council [22]. 
<P>The best solution for the Internet security is encryption. But many 
countries' governments do not approve this technique because it is a danger to 
the state security and governments can not control the information. So, it is 
why in the U.S. the public key encryption is only allowed with a 48-bit key. In 
other countries such as France and Singapore, encryption is banned. Now, 
corporations want to choose the strong security features that they need to 
protect information being communicated in electronic commerce. 
<P>While there is not and never will be a fool proof secure network, we can 
protect ourselves from the majority of the problems associated with the 
Internet. As the Internet continues to grow in popularity, it will surely grow 
with statistics of fraud, break in, and plain mischief. If you don't want to 
take the risk, turn off your computer now. 
<P>"The only system which is truly secure is one which is switched off and 
unplugged, locked in a titanium lined safe, buried in a concrete bunker, and is 
surrounded by nerve gas and very highly paid armed guards. Even then, I wouldn't 
stake my life on it." Gene Spafford 
<P>This document has dealt with the Internet security issues and has described 
the main techniques hackers use to achieve their kicks. The last chapter has 
described the methods used to improve the security. 
<P>The documentation was sometimes particularly difficult to find, especially 
that dealing with tricks hackers use to break into hosts. Moreover, I learned a 
lot of interesting things on the subject and it made me aware of this new 
important issue.
