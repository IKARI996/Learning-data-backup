[00:01.33]College English Test - Band 4
[00:05.67]Part II Listening Comprehension
[00:09.65]Section A
[00:12.15]Directions: In this section,
[00:15.49]you will hear three news reports.
[00:18.55]At the end of each news report,
[00:21.14]you will hear two or three questions.
[00:24.37]Both the news report and the questions
[00:27.53]will be spoken only once.
[00:30.36]After you hear a question,
[00:32.06]you must choose the best answer
[00:34.59]from the four choices marked A), B), C) and D).
[00:40.98]Then mark the corresponding letter on Answer Sheet 1
[00:45.31]with a single line through the centre.
[00:48.96]Questions 1 and 2 will be based on the following news item.
[00:55.18]The number of Americans over the age of 65 is expected to double
[01:00.92]between now and 2030.
[01:03.50]This next generation of retirees will be the healthiest,
[01:07.50]best educated, and most wealthy in American history.
[01:12.54]But many of them won’t have a retirement benefit
[01:16.07]their parents’ generation fought hard to get.
[01:19.61]It is something known as a defined-benefit plan, or “pension”.
[01:24.53]Retired workers who have a pension
[01:27.38]continue to be paid a certain percentage of their highest annual salary
[01:33.01]---usually anywhere from one to three percent---
[01:36.89]multiplied by the number of years they worked for the company.
[01:40.94]Pensions first became popular during World War II,
[01:44.77]when a federally-approved wage-freeze meant unions
[01:48.44]had to negotiate for retirement benefits,
[01:51.68]instead of pay increases.
[01:54.29]Pensions reached the height of their popularity in the late 1970s,
[01:59.22]when more than 60 percent of Americans had one.
[02:04.54]1. What problem does the next generation of retirees have?
[02:24.85]2. When did pensions reach the height of their popularity?
[02:44.51]Questions 3 and 4 will be based on the following news item.
[02:51.39]U.S. government health and safety officials
[02:53.68]are investigating the cause of the recent explosion
[02:56.72]at a West Virginia coal mine,
[02:58.71]which killed 12 miners.
[03:00.71]The accident was apparently an error in an industry
[03:04.45]which has prided itself on miner safety
[03:07.08]at a time of extraordinary expansion.
[03:09.73]Mine companies operate in 27 states,
[03:12.96]from West Virginia in the east to Montana in the west,
[03:16.78]producing a total of about one billion tons a year,
[03:20.88]or more than a third of the world’s coal supply.
[03:24.41]The U.S. economy is dependent on coal production.
[03:27.99]Coal-fired power plants generate about 50 percent
[03:31.27]of the nation’s electricity.
[03:33.56]More than half the nation’s coal is mined underground
[03:36.42]by thousands of men and women who daily risk injury and death.
[03:41.46]But the occupation has become much safer since the late 1960s,
[03:45.94]when the U.S. Congress passed laws
[03:48.28]requiring federal mine inspections.
[03:52.76]3. What do we learn about the recent explosion at a coal mine?
[04:13.70]4. What made the mining industry safer in the late 1960s?
[04:35.11]Questions 5 to 7 will be based on the following news item.
[04:43.24]When it comes to dieting,
[04:45.18]losing weight fast holds some appeal.
[04:48.99]Maybe that’s why U.S. News & World Report
[04:52.86]has added a Fast Weight-Loss Diet category
[04:56.65]to its annual rankings of best diet plans.
[05:00.24]And one of the diets that comes out on top
[05:03.10]is the Health Management Resources (HMR) program.
[05:07.98]HMR is a meal replacement diet
[05:11.63]that can be done on your own at home
[05:14.32]or under medical supervision.
[05:16.86]Instead of made-at-home meals,
[05:19.30]dieters can order low-calorie milk,
[05:22.13]soups,
[05:22.98]nutrition bars and multigrain cereal.
[05:26.26]The U.S. News reviewers say
[05:28.75]the plus side to the HMR diet is its quick-start option
[05:33.29]and the convenience of having meals delivered to you.
[05:37.17]The down side is “the milk lacks variety,”
[05:41.05]and it’s tough to eat out while on this diet.
[05:44.54]“A common misunderstanding is
[05:47.32]that losing weight quickly is not healthy, not sustainable,
[05:51.41]and will just lead to future weight re-gain,”
[05:54.88]wrote Carol Addy,
[05:56.21]the chief medical officer at HMR,
[05:58.85]in a release.
[06:00.40]But she says, to the contrary,
[06:03.00]“numerous studies demonstrate
[06:05.29]that following a lifestyle change program
[06:08.38]which promotes fast initial weight loss
[06:11.31]can result in better long-term success.”
[06:16.44]5. What is the HMR program?
[06:35.62]6. What is the advantage of HMR program?
[06:54.90]7. What’s the common misunderstanding about losing weight fast?
[07:13.68]
