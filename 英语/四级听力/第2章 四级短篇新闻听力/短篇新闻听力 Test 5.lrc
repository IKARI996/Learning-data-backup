[00:01.35]College English Test - Band 4
[00:04.88]Part II Listening Comprehension
[00:08.93]Section A
[00:10.92]Directions: In this section,
[00:13.51]you will hear three news reports.
[00:15.85]At the end of each news report,
[00:17.65]you will hear two or three questions.
[00:20.34]Both the news report and the questions
[00:22.43]will be spoken only once.
[00:24.92]After you hear a question,
[00:26.52]you must choose the best answer
[00:28.26]from the four choices marked A), B), C) and D).
[00:33.19]Then mark the corresponding letter on Answer Sheet 1
[00:36.67]with a single line through the centre.
[00:39.86]Questions 1 and 2 will be based on the following news item.
[00:45.43]Two months ago,
[00:46.74]Zogby International,
[00:48.30]a Washington-based research organization,
[00:50.68]conducted a public opinion poll in six Arab countries:
[00:55.01]Egypt, Jordan, Lebanon, Morocco,
[00:58.35]Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates.
[01:01.83]The respondents,
[01:03.03]randomly chosen from different neighborhoods
[01:05.28]in various cities of each country,
[01:07.18]were asked to give their opinion on a number of issues,
[01:10.51]including concerns facing their country and their personal life,
[01:14.65]economic development,
[01:16.10]employment opportunities and the likelihood of peace
[01:19.23]in the Middle East.
[01:20.87]Overall,
[01:21.82]respondents expressed more satisfaction with their lives
[01:24.90]and more optimism about their future
[01:26.97]than they did in the poll conducted ten years ago.
[01:29.67]In Lebanon,
[01:31.26]both satisfaction and optimism have doubled.
[01:34.26]This is not surprising,
[01:36.31]says James Rauch,
[01:37.60]a professor at the University of California.
[01:40.04]“The Lebanese have experienced an enormous change now
[01:43.18]with the end of the Syrian occupation.
[01:45.88]They would have good reasons to be optimistic.”
[01:50.66]1. What were the respondents asked to comment on?
[02:10.95]2. What do we learn about the result of the poll?
[02:30.63]Questions 3 and 4 will be based on the following news item.
[02:35.24]In October the Ugandan opposition leader,
[02:38.77]Kizza Basigye,
[02:40.36]returned to Kampala to prepare for the presidential elections next year.
[02:45.84]Three weeks later he was arrested.
[02:48.63]The Ugandan government says he must answer the charges,
[02:53.06]but his supporters say
[02:54.88]it’s an attempt by Ugandan President Museveni
[02:58.46]to prevent Dr. Basigye running against him.
[03:02.59]The incident is threatening
[03:04.73]to darken the country’s first multi-party elections in two decades.
[03:10.10]Western nations which provide essential economic support to Uganda
[03:15.04]have held up Uganda as a role model in the region,
[03:19.22]opposition leaders are calling on them to take a stand.
[03:23.15]In this edition of Analysis,
[03:25.49]Lucy Williamson looks at
[03:27.25]whether Uganda’s relationship with its donors is feeling the strain.
[03:34.38]3. Why did Kizza Basigye return to Kampala?
[03:54.41]4. What is the consequence of Basigye’s incident?
[04:13.97]Questions 5 to 7 will be based on the following news item.
[04:19.19]At the end of every year,
[04:20.83]U.S. weather researchers look back at
[04:23.03]what the nation’s weather was like,
[04:25.13]and what they saw last year was weird.
[04:28.06]The year was hot and annoyed
[04:30.40]by all manner of extreme weather events
[04:32.64]that did a lot of expensive damage.
[04:35.18]December, in fact, was a fitting end.
[04:38.02]“This is the first time in our 121-year period of record
[04:42.40]that a month has been both the wettest
[04:44.78]and the warmest month on record,”
[04:46.92]says Jake Crouch,
[04:48.17]a weather researcher.
[04:50.31]The rest of the year was very wet and hot too, he says
[04:53.99]---the second-hottest period on record for the U.S.
[04:57.42]The cause: a warming climate and a super strong El Nino.
[05:02.80]El Nino is a weather phenomenon out of the ocean
[05:06.87]that hits every few years and affects weather globally.
[05:10.65]Together,
[05:11.65]climate and a very strong El Nino pushed the weather
[05:15.14]in the U.S. as warm as its 20th century average.
[05:19.36]And even when the atmosphere is only that much warmer,
[05:22.61]it holds more moisture,
[05:24.73]leading to record snows in the Northeast last February and March,
[05:29.36]and record rain in the South and Midwest.
[05:34.09]5. What was weather in the U.S. like last year?
[05:54.66]6. What made last year’s weather so wired?
[06:14.32]7. What happened in the Northwest of the U.S. last February and March?
[06:35.20]
