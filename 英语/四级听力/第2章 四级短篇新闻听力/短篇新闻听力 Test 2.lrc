[00:01.40]College English Test - Band 4
[00:05.74]Part II Listening Comprehension
[00:09.99]Section A
[00:12.41]Directions: In this section,
[00:15.61]you will hear three news reports.
[00:18.57]At the end of each news report,
[00:21.11]you will hear two or three questions.
[00:24.66]Both the news report and the questions
[00:27.68]will be spoken only once.
[00:30.37]After you hear a question,
[00:32.28]you must choose the best answer
[00:34.63]from the four choices marked A), B), C) and D).
[00:41.08]Then mark the corresponding letter on Answer Sheet 1
[00:45.33]with a single line through the centre.
[00:49.02]Questions 1 and 2 will be based on the following news item.
[00:55.87]The number of girls married in Africa is expected to double
[01:00.23]in the next 35 years, experts say.
[01:03.67]That means almost half,
[01:05.63]or 310 million girls,
[01:08.53]by 2050 will be married before they reach adulthood,
[01:12.78]says a United Nation’s report.
[01:15.49]The African Union says it wants to end child marriage in Africa.
[01:21.24]Delegates at a summit in Zambia are expected to set 18 years old
[01:27.19]as the lowest legal age for marriage across the continent.
[01:31.99]Marriage before age 18 is already against the law
[01:35.69]in most African countries.
[01:37.93]Yet the UN says
[01:39.53]more than 125 million African women and girls alive today
[01:45.10]were married before their 18th birthday.
[01:49.04]Experts say most were given to men in traditional or religious unions
[01:53.39]in violation of the law.
[01:55.60]African Union chairwoman Nkosozana Dlamini Zuma says
[02:00.79]local culture that undervalues girls and women is to blame.
[02:05.84]Poverty and lack of education are also responsible,
[02:10.08]experts say.
[02:13.01]1. What do we learn from the United Nation’s report?
[02:32.48]2. What is the reason for child marriage in Africa?
[02:51.99]Questions 3 and 4 will be based on the following news item.
[02:58.68]Waste products from a popular alcoholic drink
[03:01.68]could be used in the future to make biofuel.
[03:05.02]Researchers say the new fuel,
[03:07.02]based on whisky,
[03:08.42]could reduce demand for oil.
[03:10.98]They say using less oil could cut pollution
[03:13.68]that studies have linked to climate change.
[03:16.43]Scotland is the largest producer of whisky in the world.
[03:20.03]And a Scottish professor has found how to take the waste products
[03:23.92]from distilling whisky and turn them into a form of alcohol
[03:27.25]called biobutanol.
[03:29.74]Biobutanol can be used as a fuel.
[03:33.19]Whisky comes from grain,
[03:34.90]such as corn and wheat.
[03:36.65]Martin Tangney is director of the Biofuel Research Centre
[03:40.96]at Napier University in Edinburgh.
[03:43.76]He says less than 10 percent of what comes out
[03:46.70]can be considered whisky.
[03:48.65]The rest is mainly one of two unwanted products:
[03:52.05]strong beer and wheat.
[03:54.59]Tangney says the two byproducts can be produced
[03:57.60]to create a new material: biobutanol.
[04:02.46]3. What is the news report mainly about?
[04:22.69]4. What are the unwanted products in making whisky?
[04:42.82]Questions 5 to 7 will be based on the following news item.
[04:49.41]For several years,
[04:51.27]human resources director Pete Tapaskar says
[04:54.97]it’s been a challenge to fill all the jobs
[04:57.41]at his suburban Chicago-based technology company.
[05:01.42]Getting high skilled people is still a challenge.
[05:05.57]Elizabeth Sue is principal policy analyst
[05:09.01]for the Chicago Metropolitan Agency for Planning,
[05:12.58]who studies Chicago's recent immigration trends.
[05:16.57]She said “They are slowly moving into the south,
[05:20.72]especially Texas, and Atlanta, Georgia.
[05:24.33]What we are seeing right now
[05:26.13]is a substantially decreased total of international in-migrations.
[05:31.83]Prior to the recession
[05:33.38]we were between 50 and 60 thousand most years.
[05:37.84]Now, since 2010,
[05:40.31]we’ve been at about 23- to 24-thousand international in-migrations
[05:46.30]on a net basis.”
[05:48.15]She says that dramatic drop
[05:50.65]---as much as two-thirds some years---
[05:53.05]contributes to Chicago’s overall still population growth.
[05:58.18]Tapaskar says there are many reasons
[06:00.68]why immigrants choose to live in Southern states instead of Chicago.
[06:06.61]“The environment there is ideal for starting a business,
[06:10.25]could be the taxes there are low,
[06:13.05]and employers are getting a lot of benefits from the state government.”
[06:17.85]But Tapaskar says
[06:19.06]one thing that could bring new immigrants to Chicago
[06:22.46]is increasing the number of work visas
[06:25.26]that would attract the highly skilled tech workers
[06:28.29]his business needs.
[06:30.88]5. What is the problem for the technology companies in Chicago?
[06:51.17]6. What do we learn about international in-migrations in Chicago?
[07:11.81]7. Why do immigrants choose southern states instead of Chicago?
[07:32.12]
