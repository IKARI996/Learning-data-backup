[00:05.72]Part II Listening Comprehension
[00:09.94]Section A
[00:11.84]Directions: In this section,
[00:15.73]you will hear three news reports.
[00:18.63]At the end of each news report,
[00:21.08]you will hear two or three questions.
[00:24.45]Both the news report and the questions
[00:27.66]will be spoken only once.
[00:30.43]After you hear a question,
[00:32.33]you must choose the best answer
[00:34.63]from the four choices marked A), B), C) and D).
[00:40.94]Then mark the corresponding letter on Answer Sheet 1
[00:45.19]with a single line through the centre.
[00:48.94]Questions 1 and 2 will be based on the following news item.
[00:56.78]There are about 650,000 school-aged Syrian refugee children in Turkey.
[01:03.22]Government officials estimate
[01:04.72]only about one-third of them are going to school.
[01:08.28]Educating the refugee children is an enormous task.
[01:12.42]One U.S. official says
[01:14.12]that a huge school system like the one in New York City
[01:17.22]would be overwhelmed.
[01:19.21]The United States says
[01:20.91]it is working with the United Nations
[01:22.75]to help bridge the education gap for refugee children.
[01:26.64]Without school,
[01:27.70]the effects will be negative and long-lasting.
[01:31.06]The United States provided Turkey with aid for education earlier.
[01:35.60]In December,
[01:36.77]it offered an additional 24 million dollars.
[01:40.41]Human Rights Watch says
[01:41.80]a quality education will ensure a more stable future for these children.
[01:46.74]The organization says
[01:48.49]about 90 percent of children in refugee camps
[01:51.70]run by the Turkish government attend school.
[01:54.71]But most of the children living outside of those camps
[01:57.77]are not receiving education.
[02:01.51]1. What is the news report mainly about?
[02:21.80]2. What did the United States do to help refugee children?
[02:42.84]Questions 3 and 4 will be based on the following news item.
[02:49.36]Eleven Taliban fighters attacked an important airport
[02:53.35]in southern Afghanistan early Tuesday,
[02:56.60]killing at least 50 people,
[02:58.80]Afghan officials said.
[03:01.01]The Afghan Defense Ministry said 38 civilians,
[03:05.02]10 soldiers and two police officers were killed.
[03:10.19]The attack on the Kandahar Air Field lasted 20 hours,
[03:14.59]reported The Washington Post.
[03:16.95]Among the dead were women and children,
[03:19.70]the newspaper wrote.
[03:21.60]The airport includes a military base
[03:24.05]with troops from the North Atlantic Treaty Organization, or NATO.
[03:29.33]There were no reports
[03:30.78]that NATO troops were killed or injured in the attack.
[03:34.77]A spokesman for the Taliban says
[03:37.78]fighters entered the base and attacked local and foreign military troops.
[03:43.22]He said more than 150 soldiers were killed in the attack.
[03:48.06]The Taliban often makes claims about the results of their attacks
[03:52.48]that are not true.
[03:54.49]Taliban attacks have grown in number and strength
[03:57.49]in Afghanistan this year
[03:59.30]after the withdrawal last year of combat troops from other countries.
[04:06.26]3. What did Taliban fighters do early Tuesday?
[04:26.27]4. What led to the growth of Taliban attacks in Afghanistan?
[04:46.62]Questions 5 to 7 will be based on the following news item.
[04:53.43]The Australian state of Tasmania is considering raising the legal age
[04:57.88]for buying cigarettes to at least 21 and potentially as high as 25.
[05:03.22]If the plan goes ahead
[05:05.22]it will give Tasmania some of the toughest tobacco laws
[05:08.26]in the world.
[05:09.77]The current legal age to purchase,
[05:11.66]possess or smoke cigarettes in all Australian states is 18.
[05:17.09]Critics have complained
[05:18.30]the proposed restrictions would be a violation of civil liberties.
[05:22.72]Australia already has some of the world’s toughest anti-smoking policies.
[05:27.20]It introduced so-called plain packaging four years ago,
[05:31.16]where packs are coloured an identical olive brown
[05:34.76]and are covered in health warnings that include pictures.
[05:39.19]The country is also one of the most expensive places
[05:41.87]in the world to buy cigarettes
[05:43.93]---from around 15 dollars a pack.
[05:46.73]Parts of the world already ban cigarette sales to those under 21,
[05:51.58]including Kuwait and, from next year, Hawaii.
[05:55.39]Around one-in-five Tasmanians smoke,
[05:58.48]with the vast majority taking up the habit before the age of 25.
[06:03.38]The Tasmanian government proposals are part of a five-year plan
[06:07.43]to make the state Australia’s healthiest by 2025.
[06:13.73]5. What does the state of Tasmania plan to do?
[06:35.76]6. According to plain packaging,
[06:38.10]what should be included in the packs of cigarette?
[06:56.01]7. What’s the purpose of the Tasmanian government proposals?
[07:14.99]
