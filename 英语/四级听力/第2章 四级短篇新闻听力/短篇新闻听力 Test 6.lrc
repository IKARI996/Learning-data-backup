[00:01.32]College English Test - Band 4
[00:05.55]Part II Listening Comprehension
[00:09.98]Section A
[00:12.38]Directions: In this section,
[00:15.56]you will hear three news reports.
[00:18.55]At the end of each news report,
[00:21.05]you will hear two or three questions.
[00:24.44]Both the news report and the questions
[00:27.64]will be spoken only once.
[00:30.37]After you hear a question,
[00:32.26]you must choose the best answer
[00:34.60]from the four choices marked A), B), C) and D).
[00:40.87]Then mark the corresponding letter on Answer Sheet 1
[00:44.77]with a single line through the centre.
[00:48.90]Questions 1 and 2 will be based on the following news item.
[00:56.36]February is Black History Month in the United States,
[01:00.37]when Americans are encouraged to learn about
[01:02.86]and appreciate the many contributions
[01:06.22]African Americans have made to American society.
[01:10.30]Those efforts got a boost this week
[01:12.99]when the Smithsonian Institution announced its plan
[01:16.73]to build a National Museum of African American History
[01:20.56]and Culture on the National Mall,
[01:23.34]where, in about 10 years,
[01:25.29]it will join the rest of the capital city’s famed national museums
[01:29.52]and monuments.
[01:31.41]There is much to do before the museum is actually built.
[01:35.09]An architect must be chosen,
[01:37.23]the collection must be assembled,
[01:39.96]and half the museum’s 300-500 million dollars price tag
[01:44.88]must be provided from private donors.
[01:48.42]Lonnie Bunch,
[01:49.51]the director of the new museum,
[01:51.65]says this museum really desires to create an opportunity
[01:55.93]for millions of Americans to engage in
[01:59.17]and understand African American history.
[02:04.46]1. What are Americans encouraged to do in Black History Month?
[02:25.44]2. What is the plan of the Smithsonian Institution?
[02:45.08]Questions 3 and 4 will be based on the following news item.
[02:52.67]When the tsunami hit southern Thailand last year
[02:55.61]hundreds of Burmese migrants working in beach front hotels
[02:59.14]were among the victims.
[03:01.24]Thai officials have identified 80 Burmese migrant workers
[03:04.79]among the dead.
[03:06.48]But they believe several of the more than 800 unidentified bodies
[03:10.71]are likely to be Burmese.
[03:13.25]Thousands of Burmese migrant workers are employed
[03:16.15]along Thailand’s Andaman Sea coast
[03:18.79]---a source of cheap labor for contractors
[03:21.96]who often overlook the need to register the workers.
[03:25.29]Those who survived the tsunami often found their jobs,
[03:28.33]homes and belongings were gone,
[03:31.63]and that they were unable to get government aid.
[03:34.62]Adisorn Kurdmongkol,
[03:36.13]a Thai labor activist,
[03:37.83]says the disaster called attention to the problems
[03:40.51]the Burmese migrants faced even before the tsunami.
[03:45.75]3. How many unidentified bodies are likely to be Burmese?
[04:06.75]4. What happened to the surviving Burmese after last year’s tsunami?
[04:27.80]Questions 5 to 7 will be based on the following news item.
[04:34.37]The Paris agreement to curb climate change
[04:37.21]calls for a dramatic shift away from fossil fuels
[04:41.19]and the greenhouse gasses they emit,
[04:44.09]especially carbon dioxide.
[04:46.82]Switching to renewable energy helps,
[04:49.51]but that won’t happen fast enough
[04:51.90]to keep temperatures from rising to dangerous levels.
[04:56.13]That’s why scientists and researchers all over the world
[05:00.12]also are working on new ways of keeping carbon out of the atmosphere.
[05:05.48]At an industrial site in Alberta,
[05:08.26]a province in North America,
[05:10.30]Royal Dutch Shell,
[05:12.00]an oil company,
[05:13.40]recently hosted a grand opening for its Quest carbon capture
[05:17.83]and storage project.
[05:19.73]It’s part of Shell’s oil sands business.
[05:23.50]Turning oil sands into crude oil emits a lot of carbon dioxide.
[05:28.48]So Shell tries to capture some of that greenhouse gas
[05:32.13]before it gets into the air.
[05:34.67]The technology in the Quest project has been around for a while,
[05:39.10]but it’s still expensive:
[05:41.04]The cost of building and operating this one plant
[05:44.20]over the next decade is about 970 million dollars.
[05:49.54]For all that money,
[05:50.88]it captures only a third of the CO2 that’s produced here.
[05:55.66]For many companies,
[05:57.51]such a plant isn’t an attractive investment
[06:00.60]because it’s not profitable.
[06:04.78]5. What’s the purpose of Paris agreement?
[06:24.12]6. What is the content of Shell’s Quest project?
[06:43.96]7. Why doesn’t Quest’s plant attract many companies?
[07:02.08]
