[00:01.37]College English Test - Band 4
[00:04.84]Part II Listening Comprehension
[00:08.92]Section A
[00:10.56]Directions: In this section,
[00:13.54]you will hear three news reports.
[00:15.89]At the end of each news report,
[00:17.52]you will hear two or three questions.
[00:20.34]Both the news report and the questions
[00:22.28]will be spoken only once.
[00:24.92]After you hear a question,
[00:26.66]you must choose the best answer
[00:28.31]from the four choices marked A), B), C) and D).
[00:33.15]Then mark the corresponding letter on Answer Sheet 1
[00:36.70]with a single line through the centre.
[00:40.07]Questions 1 and 2 will be based on the following news item.
[00:44.76]In Bolivia,
[00:45.83]life is slowly returning to normal
[00:48.05]after almost a month of demonstrations.
[00:50.78]Thousands of mainly native people
[00:53.03]---from poor peasant farmers to miners
[00:55.73]have been demanding nationalization of the country’s gas industry
[00:59.49]and calling for constitutional reform.
[01:02.55]The protesters are angry
[01:04.29]at what they see as the exploitation of Bolivia natural resources
[01:08.66]by foreign companies and governments.
[01:11.55]There’s a long history
[01:12.89]of the country’s rich natural resources being exploited
[01:16.38]by foreigners with little financial reward for the population,
[01:20.29]60 percent of whom are of native origin.
[01:23.62]Many now hope the new president,
[01:25.42]Eduardo Rodriguez,
[01:27.10]may find a solution to the country’s problems.
[01:29.91]The new president will have more on his agenda than calling elections
[01:33.82]and deciding the future of Bolivia's natural resources.
[01:37.64]Overcoming the shocking inequality of life in this poor country
[01:41.83]is the most serious challenge,
[01:43.87]and it seems, the only way to ensure a peaceful future.
[01:49.84]1. What are the main demands of the demonstrators?
[02:09.85]2. What is the most serious challenge of the new president?
[02:30.29]Questions 3 and 4 will be based on the following news item.
[02:34.78]In this second appearance before the U.N. Committee Against Torture,
[02:39.26]the senior officials answered a number of questions
[02:42.51]about Washington’s supposed use of torture,
[02:46.12]about U.S. prisoner operations in Guantanamo Bay,
[02:49.89]Afghanistan and Iraq and about the treatment of terror suspects.
[02:55.39]The head of the U.S. delegation
[02:57.63]and legal adviser of the Department of State,
[03:00.60]John Bellinger,
[03:02.00]told the panel’s 10 independent experts
[03:05.12]that all U.S. officials and government agencies are prohibited
[03:10.03]from engaging in torture at all times and in all places.
[03:14.88]He said this is the case even in situations
[03:18.04]where the law of armed conflict applies.
[03:21.36]In an effort to silence the critics,
[03:23.93]Bellinger said the United States believes everyone is entitled
[03:27.92]to humane treatment.
[03:30.02]He said freedom from torture is a right
[03:32.44]that can never be taken away.
[03:37.16]3. What guilt was the U.S. accused of?
[03:56.02]4. How many independent experts are there in the panel?
[04:16.25]Questions 5 to 7 will be based on the following news item.
[04:20.94]Korean language studies are quickly growing in popularity
[04:24.55]across the United States.
[04:26.40]The Modern Language Association says
[04:28.53]the number of U.S. college students taking a Korean language class
[04:32.87]rose by almost 45% over the last few years.
[04:36.75]The group notes that the increase comes at a time
[04:39.80]when the number of college students taking foreign language classes
[04:43.04]has declined.
[04:44.71]Many people around the world like the sound of K-pop,
[04:48.16]Korean popular music.
[04:50.00]Also, the children of Korean immigrants want to speak
[04:53.81]to their parents and grandparents in Korean.
[04:57.16]Professor Sung-Ock Sohn teaches Korean classes at UCLA.
[05:02.10]She says another reason people want to learn the language
[05:05.54]is the growing economic power of South Korea.
[05:08.98]Professor David Schaberg,
[05:11.11]Dean of Humanities at the University of California,
[05:14.27]says the popularity of Korean language training
[05:17.16]is also affecting American culture.
[05:20.16]He says it shows that American culture is becoming more Asian,
[05:24.39]or at least opening up to more Asian influences.
[05:28.47]Language researchers say
[05:30.43]the growing number of U.S. students taking Korean language classes
[05:34.36]shows no sign of ending anytime soon.
[05:37.63]Their reasons:
[05:38.74]the popularity of K-pop
[05:40.39]and the rising number of Korean-Americans
[05:42.93]seeking to re-connect with older family members.
[05:47.81]5. What is K-pop?
[06:07.15]6. Why is Korean gaining popularity in the U.S. recently?
[06:27.82]7. What does Professor Schaberg think of this phenomenon?
[06:45.22]
