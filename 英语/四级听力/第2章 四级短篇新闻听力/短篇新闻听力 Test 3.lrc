[00:08.60]Section A
[00:10.71]Directions: In this section,
[00:13.49]you will hear three news reports.
[00:15.99]At the end of each news report,
[00:17.68]you will hear two or three questions.
[00:20.08]Both the news report and the questions
[00:22.46]will be spoken only once.
[00:25.05]After you hear a question,
[00:26.91]you must choose the best answer
[00:28.40]from the four choices marked A), B), C) and D).
[00:32.98]Then mark the corresponding letter on Answer Sheet 1
[00:36.46]with a single line through the centre.
[00:40.16]Questions 1 and 2 will be based on the following news item.
[00:44.89]In a statement,
[00:45.98]the US president says he is taking the action,
[00:48.72]because the conflict in Darfur threatens the national security
[00:53.26]and foreign policy of the United States.
[00:56.24]The asset freeze is being imposed on four Sudanese
[00:59.98]identified by the U.N. Security Council as being involved
[01:03.37]in organizing and carrying out cruel and violent actions in Darfur.
[01:08.56]The president’s order comes days
[01:10.91]before rallies are planned in Washington and throughout the United States
[01:15.30]to protest the three-year war in Darfur.
[01:18.58]Celebrities such as Academy Award winning actor George Clooney
[01:22.61]are scheduled to speak at the rally.
[01:25.05]Clooney, who just returned from a trip to the Darfur region,
[01:28.90]told reporters in Washington the world’s attention needs to be focused
[01:33.33]on what he called the “first massive murder of the 21st century.”
[01:39.81]1. Why is the U.S. president taking actions in Darfur?
[02:00.88]2. Who is scheduled to speak at the rally?
[02:20.24]Questions 3 and 4 will be based on the following news item.
[02:24.27]When the top U.S. oil companies announced huge increases
[02:28.22]in profits this week,
[02:30.21]many consumer advocates raised complaints.
[02:33.69]At a time when American motorists are paying record-level prices
[02:37.93]for gasoline,
[02:39.28]some in the U.S. Congress think
[02:41.54]the oil company profits should be examined closely.
[02:45.57]The U.S. Senate Finance Committee is seeking tax return information
[02:51.04]on top U.S. oil companies from the Internal Revenue Service
[02:55.72]and some politicians are calling for a windfall profits tax.
[03:00.91]Of course,
[03:02.00]oil companies oppose such a move,
[03:04.69]citing similar or even higher profit increases in other industries,
[03:09.58]such as real estate,
[03:10.87]that have not caused controversy.
[03:13.75]Oil industry analysts,
[03:15.75]however,
[03:16.15]say a windfall profits tax might be counterproductive.
[03:20.98]Bob Tippee, editor of Houston-based Oil and Gas Journal,
[03:25.80]says large oil company profits could benefit consumers in the end.
[03:32.73]3. What are the reactions to the oil companies’ huge increases in profits?
[03:53.85]4. What do the oil industry analysts think of the windfall profits tax?
[04:15.30]Questions 5 to 7 will be based on the following news item.

[04:36.56]the capital of Manipur state,
[04:38.61]according to the US Geological Survey.
[04:41.31]Strong quakes have been felt across the region.
[04:44.44]The earthquake was originally reported
[04:46.54]to have measured 6.8 on the Richter scale.
[04:49.55]India’s Meteorological Department said
[04:52.04]it struck at a depth of 17 km.
