[00:24.65]Both the news report and the questions
[00:27.62]will be spoken only once.
[00:30.42]After you hear a question,
[00:32.34]you must choose the best answer
[00:34.75]from the four choices marked A), B), C) and D).

[00:58.77]hold canned food drives to help those in need.
[01:02.59]One Pennsylvania faith-based relief organization
[01:06.61]holds a drive with a twist:
[01:09.07]volunteers can the food themselves.
[01:12.25]Each winter,
[01:13.37]the Mennonite Central Committee sends a meat-canning truck
[01:17.08]on a tour of North America.
[01:19.65]The truck is equipped with industrial-size pressure cookers,
[01:23.76]and each community it visits mounts an all-out effort
[01:27.26]to can as much meat as possible
[01:30.05]before the truck moves on to the next stop.
[01:33.59]About 30 people crowd into a small barn on a farm
[01:37.66]just outside of Freeport, Illinois.
[01:40.93]They work in shifts,
[01:42.37]from 5 in the morning until 10 at night.
[01:45.40]Over the course of two days,
[01:47.63]they cook and can over 6,300 kilos of turkey meat
[01:53.00]to be sent to hungry people all over the world.
[01:58.17]1. What is the news report mainly about?
[02:17.33]2. How long do the volunteers work in a small barn
[02:22.10]on a farm outside of Freeport?

[02:46.10]Cell phones have become a central force
[02:48.73]in the daily life of teens around the world.

[02:55.07]they use their cell phones to connect with web sites,
[02:57.96]play music and games,
[02:59.54]and take pictures.
[03:01.18]Now, a U.S. college is holding a competition,
[03:04.75]giving young people a chance to get really creative
[03:07.96]with this tiny hand held device.
[03:10.57]They’re being challenged to produce a cell phone film.
[03:14.39]“It needs to be edited.
[03:16.44]It needs to have some kind of audio,
[03:18.46]voice-over or music,
[03:20.25]and it needs to tell a story.”
[03:22.12]And said contest organizer Dianne Lynch.
[03:25.66]It must be shot entirely with cell phones.
[03:28.86]She says that the best film will not be very different

[04:30.48]near the border with Lebanon.
[04:32.83]The second attack killed people
[04:35.19]who gathered to see the damage of an earlier car bomb.
[04:39.53]A suicide bomber entered the crowd
[04:41.98]and exploded a bomb hidden in clothing.
[04:45.42]The attacks took place in the al-Zahraa district,
