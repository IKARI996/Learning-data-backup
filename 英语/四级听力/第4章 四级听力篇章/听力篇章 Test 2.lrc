[00:00.53]Section C
[00:02.76]Directions: In this section,
[00:05.81]you will hear three passages.
[00:08.21]At the end of each passage,
[00:10.68]you will hear some questions.
[00:13.04]Both the passage and the questions
[00:15.68]will be spoken only once.
[00:18.58]After you hear a question,
[00:20.98]you must choose the best answer from the four choices
[00:25.17]marked A), B), C) and D).
[00:29.23]Then mark the corresponding letter on Answer Sheet 1
[00:33.74]with a single line through the centre.
[00:37.58]Passage One
[00:39.68]We don't know how the first fire was made.
[00:42.67]Early fires on the earth were certainly caused by nature, not by man.
[00:47.40]Some were caused by lightning in a storm;
[00:50.39]others, perhaps by one hot material which came out of a volcano.
[00:55.24]Quite possibly, at times,
[00:57.29]the heat of the sun set light to some dry grass or leaves.
[01:00.94]At first, man, like other animals,
[01:03.59]was probably afraid of fire.
[01:05.69]He saw that fire could destroy a forest;
[01:08.72]he knew that fire could hurt his body.
[01:11.54]So great was the power of fire that he feared it and worshipped it.
[01:16.97]Gradually, however, with his better powers of thinking,
[01:20.41]he overcame his fear.
[01:22.27]Probably he overcame most of his fear
[01:25.55]when he discovered how to make fire for himself.
[01:28.86]Throughout the ages he has learned more about fire,
[01:32.90]how to control it,
[01:34.89]and how to use it in many ways.
[01:37.44]Now fire is no longer a master or a god,
[01:40.64]it is a servant.
[01:42.30]Again, at some early date,
[01:44.16]man found how fire could be used to make certain metals from rocks.
[01:49.14]Some time later, he found out how to make the metal
[01:53.09]which we now call bronze.
[01:55.06]This is a mixture of copper and tin.
[01:58.16]Bronze was a very useful metal.
[02:00.91]It was hard and tough,
[02:02.72]but he could shape it by hammering (probably with heavy stones).
[02:07.36]He could make a tool with a sharp edge for cutting.
[02:10.85]It isn't so easy to get iron from its ore
[02:14.15]and this metal was probably not discovered
[02:16.70]until very much later.
[02:19.04]Questions 16 to 18 are based on the passage you have just heard.
[02:24.44]16. What do we know about early fires on the earth?
[02:44.90]17. What was probably man's response to the first fire?
[03:05.06]18. What is bronze made of?
[03:23.70]Passage Two
[03:25.60]The World Carnival is set to start its second funfair
[03:29.09]in Beijing at the end of the month.
[03:31.19]While young people can hardly wait to rush
[03:33.44]to the huge mobile amusement park,
[03:35.64]people living in the neighborhood where the carnival locates
[03:38.49]are worrying about the possible environmental damage.
[03:41.64]Last summer the World Carnival left Beijing
[03:44.29]with a huge scar on the grassland of the International Sculpture Park.
[03:47.98]To help the settlement of the mobile amusement park,
[03:51.11]about 55,000 square meters of greenery was removed last year,
[03:56.01]including nearly 200 big trees.
[03:58.71]This year however,
[04:00.26]the World Carnival has been more careful in settling people's concerns.
[04:04.25]An environmental evaluation has been done
[04:07.25]to the whole project and the report approved.
[04:10.22]William Stevens, Chairman of World Carnival Ltd. further explains.
[04:14.60]And if you're keen to go to this year's carnival
[04:17.30]and you've never been to one before,
[04:18.86]the following are some tips our entertainment editors have summarized.
[04:23.11]Do not wear skirts or clothes made of filmy material;
[04:26.72]Do not hang down your hair loosely;
[04:29.71]Take off your spectacles before enjoying thrill rides;
[04:33.26]Do not wear slippers;
[04:35.08]Leave games for the end of your day's enjoyment
[04:37.64]to avoid the burden of carrying around big prizes;
[04:40.73]Do not eat too much or leave your stomach empty
[04:43.87]before enjoying yourself;
[04:45.34]And finally, do not overindulge in the games or rides.
[04:50.15]Questions 19 to 21 are based on the passage you have just heard.
[04:56.14]19. What do people living in the neighborhood worry about?
[05:17.33]20. Where was the World Carnival held last year?
[05:37.04]21. What are the visitors advised to do at the World Carnival?
[05:57.52]Passage Three
[06:00.03]A South African businessman is refusing to leave Croatia
[06:04.33]until he finds a girl who he saw across a crowded bar.
[06:07.32]Keith Van Der Spuy has never even spoken to the girl
[06:11.87]but says she was the most beautiful woman he has ever seen.
[06:15.02]He has cancelled his flight home
[06:17.26]and taken out advertisements in local newspapers
[06:20.27]in the port town of Split.
[06:22.51]Mr. Van Der Spuy says he was having a drink in the bar
[06:26.30]when he saw the pretty girl smile at him across the bar.
[06:29.30]While he was trying to look at her closely she disappeared.
[06:33.46]But he's convinced she was a local
[06:36.16]because he heard her calling to a female friend
[06:38.80]shortly before he lost sight of her.
[06:41.30]Van Der Spuy, who is also the head
[06:43.95]of the South African water-polo association,
[06:46.77]said he could not get her out of his mind
[06:49.16]and when he got to the airport,
[06:51.11]then he realized he could not board the plane.
[06:54.36]He has already extended his holiday for four months,
[06:58.26]and says he is prepared to stay in Split for as long as it takes.
[07:02.90]"I will not leave this place for years if I have to.
[07:06.79]When I saw her and she looked at me I knew she was the one.
[07:10.29]There was pure chemistry between us.
[07:13.33]I can't get her out of my head.
[07:15.33]I just want to meet her
[07:16.95]and see her long dark hair and beautiful smile again.
[07:20.51]She is the most beautiful woman I have ever seen."
[07:23.70]"If she is married or is not interested I can accept it
[07:28.10]―but I have to know.
[07:29.49]I have to see her one more time,
[07:31.49]and I have even bought a diamond ring for her."
[07:35.09]Questions 22 to 25 are based on the passage you have just heard.
[07:41.33]22. How long has the man decided to stay in Split?
[08:01.54]23. Where was the man when he saw the pretty girl?
[08:20.94]24. What do we know from the passage?
[08:41.24]25. What will the man do if the woman is not interested in him?
[08:56.06]
