[00:01.06]Section C
[00:02.52]Directions: In this section,
[00:06.11]you will hear three passages.
[00:08.15]At the end of each passage,
[00:09.75]you will hear some questions.
[00:11.76]Both the passage and the questions
[00:13.65]will be spoken only once.
[00:16.06]After you hear a question,
[00:17.66]you must choose the best answer from the four choices
[00:20.92]marked A), B), C) and D).
[00:24.71]Then mark the corresponding letter on Answer Sheet 1
[00:28.47]with a single line through the centre.
[00:31.77]Passage One
[00:33.61]Professors from Yale University agreed in a panel discussion tonight
[00:37.01]that the automobile was what one of them called
[00:39.72]"Public Health Enemy No. 1 in This Country".
[00:42.57]Besides polluting the air and overcrowding the cities,
[00:46.02]automobiles could cause heart disease
[00:48.31]"because we don't walk anywhere any more,"
[00:50.08]said Dr. H. P. Richard Weinerman,
[00:52.48]professor of medicine and public health.
[00:54.94]Dr. Weinerman's sharp accusation against the automobile
[00:58.24]came in a discussion of human environment on Yale Reports,
[01:01.74]a radio program broadcast by Station WTIC in Hartford, Connecticut.
[01:07.05]The program opened a three-part series on "Staying Alive".
[01:10.85]"For the first time in human history,
[01:13.35]the problem of man's survival has to do
[01:15.50]with his control of man-made hazards,"
[01:17.66]Dr. Weinerman said.
[01:19.07]"Before this,
[01:20.04]the problem had been the control of natural hazards."
[01:23.49]Questions 16 to 18 are based on the passage you have just heard.
[01:31.35]16. What is the main idea of the passage?
[01:50.84]17. Why could automobiles cause heart disease?
[02:11.49]18. For the first time,
[02:14.23]what does the problem of man's survival have to do with?
[02:33.77]Passage Two
[02:35.59]Whether it's curled up,
[02:37.85]flat on the stomach or stretched out across the bed,
[02:41.04]the way people sleep reveals their personality,
[02:44.29]a British sleep expert said.
[02:46.55]Professor Chris Idzikowski,
[02:49.99]director of the Sleep Assessment and Advisory Service,
[02:53.13]has identified six common sleep positions and what they mean.
[02:58.58]Crouched in the fetal position is the most popular sleep pattern
[03:03.17]and favored by 51 percent of women,
[03:05.91]according to the results of the study he conducted for a large hotel group.
[03:10.56]Fetal sleepers tend to be shy and sensitive
[03:14.22]while people who take the soldier position,
[03:17.31]flat on their back with arms at their sides,
[03:20.36]are quiet and reserved.
[03:22.46]Sleeping on one's side with legs outstretched
[03:25.79]and arms down in what Idzikowski refers to as the log,
[03:30.33]indicates a social, easy-going personality.
[03:34.18]But if the arms are out-stretched in a yearning position,
[03:37.77]the person tends to be more suspicious.
[03:40.68]The freefall, flat on the stomach
[03:43.49]with the hands at the sides of the head,
[03:45.64]is the most unusual position.
[03:47.98]Only 6.5 percent of people prefer it
[03:51.68]and they are usually rash and sociable.
[03:54.92]Unassuming, good listeners usually adopt the starfish position
[03:59.87]-on the back with outstretched arms and legs.
[04:03.54]Idzikowski, who identified the positions
[04:06.79]by comparing personality traits of people,
[04:09.80]their preferred way of sleeping and the most common positions,
[04:13.14]said once a sleeping style is adopted it is rarely changed.
[04:19.14]Questions 19 to 21 are based on the passage you have just heard.
[04:24.49]19. How many common sleep positions did the professor identify?
[04:45.94]20. What is true about sleepers in the soldier position?
[05:06.07]21. What is not revealed by the study?
[05:25.99]Passage Three
[05:28.08]May and June are the months
[05:29.43]when most American colleges and universities
[05:31.98]hold their graduation ceremonies.
[05:34.13]These ceremonies are a time for family and friends
[05:37.18]to gather and celebrate a student's completion of an academic degree.
[05:41.42]Most ceremonies are traditional.
[05:43.42]The students wear caps and gowns over their clothing.
[05:46.71]One by one, their names are called.
[05:48.96]They go to the front,
[05:49.98]shake hands with school officials and receive a document of some kind.
[05:53.79]But first they must sit and listen to speeches.
[05:56.53]Colleges and universities often invite famous guests
[05:59.68]or former students who have been successful.
[06:02.12]Schools often want speakers to comment on world events.
[06:05.61]This Saturday, for example,
[06:07.43]Senator Hillary Rodham Clinton will speak at the graduation ceremony
[06:11.27]at the Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute in Troy, New York.
[06:16.20]News people are often invited to speak at graduations.
[06:18.85]So are entertainers.
[06:20.10]Actor John Lithgow, a 1967 graduate of Harvard,
[06:23.50]will speak at the university on June 9th.
[06:26.45]Then there are speakers like Jon Stewart.
[06:28.61]He entertains by making fun of the news.
[06:31.20]His popular program, "The Daily Show,"
[06:33.91]appears on Comedy Central on cable television.
[06:36.43]Last year, Jon Stewart spoke
[06:38.42]at the College of William and Mary in Williamsburg, Virginia.
[06:41.29]He graduated from there in 1984.
[06:44.13]He did offer some serious advice.
[06:46.78]He said: "College is something you complete.
[06:49.17]Life is something you experience.
[06:51.47]So don't worry about your grade,
[06:53.23]or the results or success.
[06:55.11]Success is defined in various ways,
[06:57.17]and you will find it... Love what you do.
[06:59.93]Get good at it."
[07:01.58]Questions 22 to 25 are based on the passage you have just heard.
[07:07.73]22. When do most American universities hold their graduation ceremonies?
[07:31.72]23. Who are often invited to speak at the graduation ceremonies?
[07:54.10]24. Which university did the actor John Lithgow graduate from?
[08:16.73]25. What advice did Jon Stewart give
[08:21.71]at the ceremony of the College of William and Mary?
[08:38.52]
