[00:01.06]Section C
[00:02.52]Directions: In this section,
[00:06.11]you will hear three passages.
[00:08.15]At the end of each passage,
[00:09.75]you will hear some questions.
[00:11.76]Both the passage and the questions
[00:13.65]will be spoken only once.
[00:16.06]After you hear a question,
[00:17.66]you must choose the best answer from the four choices
[00:20.92]marked A), B), C) and D).
[00:24.71]Then mark the corresponding letter on Answer Sheet 1
[00:28.47]with a single line through the centre.
[00:31.86]Passage One
[00:33.92]Saving money is a first step toward wealth.
[00:37.59]Putting money away for the future also supports the banking system.
[00:42.15]Banks need a supply of savings to provide money for loans.
[00:46.65]In the United States,
[00:48.75]people who want to start a savings have many choices.
[00:52.26]Banks, savings-and-loans and credit unions
[00:56.21]are traditional places to open an account.
[00:59.12]Credit unions are cooperatives for people
[01:02.38]who are linked in some way.
[01:03.97]For example, the members may work for a university or a government agency.
[01:09.47]Most credit unions are non-profit organizations.
[01:13.88]Savers have their money guaranteed up to one hundred thousand dollars.
[01:18.82]Banks and other financial organizations pay interest on savings accounts.
[01:25.31]But the interest rates are low.
[01:28.26]Certificates of deposit are another way to save.
[01:31.91]They pay higher interest rates.
[01:34.60]With a certificate of deposit,
[01:36.20]a person agrees not to withdraw an amount of money for a period of time.
[01:41.04]The term could be three months,
[01:42.84]or it could be several years.
[01:44.59]Longer terms, and larger amounts, pay higher interest.
[01:48.73]People can withdraw their money early but at a cost.
[01:52.88]Another way to save is through a money market fund.
[01:56.54]This is a kind of mutual fund.
[01:59.37]Mutual funds invest money from many people.
[02:02.98]Money market funds pay higher interest than savings accounts.
[02:07.98]The money is usually placed in short-term government securities.
[02:12.14]Money market funds, however,
[02:14.18]may not be federally guaranteed like other kinds of savings.
[02:19.42]Questions 16 to 18 are based on the passage you have just heard.
[02:25.20]16. What are the traditional places to open an account in the United States?
[02:47.37]17. Which group can form a credit union?
[03:06.63]18. Which way of saving may not be federally guaranteed?
[03:29.04]Passage Two
[03:30.60]One of the greatest heartbreaks for firefighters occurs
[03:34.16]when they fail to rescue a child from a burning building
[03:37.50]because the child, frightened by smoke and noise,
[03:41.49]hides under a bed or in a closet and is later found dead.
[03:46.72]Saddest of all is when children catch a glimpse
[03:50.64]of the masked the firefighter but hide
[03:53.03]because they think they have seen a monster.
[03:56.28]To prevent such tragedies,
[03:58.69]firefighter Eric Velez gives talks to children in his community,
[04:04.35]explaining that they should never hide during a fire.
[04:08.39]He displays firefighters' equipment, including the oxygen mask,
[04:13.59]which he encourages his listeners to play with and put on.
[04:17.85]"If you see us," Velez tells them,
[04:21.27]"don't hide! We are not monsters.
[04:24.78]We have come to rescue you."
[04:26.78]Velez gives his presentations in English and Spanish.
[04:32.30]Growing up in San Francisco,
[04:35.05]he learned Spanish from his immigrant parents.
[04:38.40]Velez and other firefighters throughout North America,
[04:42.93]who give similar presentations,
[04:45.39]will never know how many lives they save through their talks.
[04:49.64]But it's a fact that informative speaking saves lives.
[04:55.40]For example, several months after listening to an informative speech,
[05:00.46]Pete Gentry in North Carolina rescued his brother
[05:04.32]who is choking on food,
[05:06.53]by using the method taught by student speaker,
[05:09.62]Julie Paris. In addition to saving lives,
[05:13.73]informative speakers help people learn new skills,
[05:18.17]solve problems and acquire fascinating facts
[05:21.77]about the exciting world in which they live.
[05:25.76]Questions 19 to 22 are based on the passage you have just heard.
[05:31.82]19. Why do some children trapped in a burning building
[05:36.74]hide from masked firefighters?
[05:54.88]20. What does the passage tell us about firefighter Eric Velez?
[06:17.13]21. What do we learn about Pete Gentry?
[06:37.37]22. What message is the speaker trying to convey?
[06:57.90]Passage Three
[07:02.06]Imagine that someone in your neighborhood broke the law,
[07:05.86]and the judge put the whole neighborhood under suspicion.
[07:10.21]How fair would that be?
[07:12.61]Well, it happens every day to high-schoolers.
[07:16.77]Just because some students have stolen things in shops,
[07:21.11]all of us are treated like thieves. Even though I'd never steal.
[07:26.70]Store employees looked at me like
[07:28.91]I'm some kind of hardened criminal.
[07:32.45]For example, during one lunch period,
[07:35.22]my friend Denny and I went to the Grab and Go Restaurant
[07:39.66]to have a hotdog.
[07:41.00]We arrived to find a line of students waiting outside.
[07:45.30]A new sign in the window told the story.
[07:49.30]"No more than two students at a time".
[07:53.45]After 15 minutes, we finally got in.
[07:58.04]But the store manager laid the evil eye on us.
[08:01.80]I asked him about the new sign, and he said,
[08:05.21]"You kids are stealing too much stuff." You kids?
[08:10.57]Too much stuff? We were not only assumed to be thieves,
[08:15.78]but brilliant, greedy thieves. The most annoying thing though,
[08:21.28]is the way employees watched my friends and me.
[08:24.57]It's horrible. Once, at a drugstore,
[08:28.53]I was looking around and found a guy standing on a large box,
[08:33.32]stocking the shelves. He was watching my hands,
[08:37.53]more than he was watching his own.
[08:40.24]I showed him that my hands were empty.
[08:43.24]He got down off his box and rushed off,
[08:46.64]as if he was going to get the store manager.
[08:49.23]How crazy is that!
[08:52.19]Questions 23 to 25 are based on the passage you have just heard.
[08:58.30]23. What does the speaker find to be unfair?
[09:19.36]24. What measure did the Grab and Go Restaurant take to stop stealing?
[09:41.04]25. What happened in a drugstore that greatly annoyed the speaker?
[10:01.12]
