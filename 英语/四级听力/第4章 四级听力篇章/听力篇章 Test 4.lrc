[00:00.53]Section C
[00:02.76]Directions: In this section,
[00:05.81]you will hear three passages.
[00:08.21]At the end of each passage,
[00:10.68]you will hear some questions.
[00:13.04]Both the passage and the questions
[00:15.68]will be spoken only once.
[00:18.58]After you hear a question,
[00:20.98]you must choose the best answer from the four choices
[00:25.17]marked A), B), C) and D).
[00:29.23]Then mark the corresponding letter on Answer Sheet 1
[00:33.74]with a single line through the centre.
[00:37.80]Passage One
[00:39.55]As more and more people lose their jobs,
[00:41.96]now is perhaps the time to consider the experience of unemployment.
[00:45.57]What are the first feelings?
[00:47.51]Well, losing a job, or not being able to find one,
[00:50.28]almost always brings unwelcome changes.
[00:52.99]As well as the loss of income,
[00:54.68]many people find the whole routine of their life is shattered,
[00:57.96]their contact with other people reduced,
[00:59.98]their ambitions halted and their identity as a worker removed.
[01:03.98]At first there may be good feelings too
[01:06.43]―a new and better job is just around the corner
[01:09.27]―it's nice to be able to lie in bed in the morning
[01:11.66]or spend more time with the children;
[01:13.40]have more time to think.
[01:14.70]But, unless a better job does turn up,
[01:17.25]the chances are the days start getting longer
[01:19.56]and time becomes harder to fill.
[01:22.02]Many people pass through periods of difficulty in sleeping and eating.
[01:26.68]They feel irritable and depressed,
[01:28.94]often isolated and lonely.
[01:30.71]Despite all these problems though,
[01:33.16]unemployment can be a chance for a fresh start.
[01:35.66]You can discover that it provides an opportunity
[01:38.31]to sort out or rethink what you want from life
[01:40.98]and how best you can get it.
[01:42.80]You can use the time to plan how to find a new job,
[01:45.45]learn a new skill, develop your hobbies
[01:47.79]or see if you can run your own business.
[01:51.37]Questions 16 to 18 are based on the passage you have just heard.
[01:57.77]16. What are the first feelings when one is jobless?
[02:18.07]17. What do the unemployed feel before finding a new job?
[02:38.77]18. What does the speaker try to tell us?
[02:58.13]Passage Two
[02:59.93]From the beginning of human history,
[03:02.52]people have used oils from seeds and nuts.
[03:05.82]Most of the time these oils are used as food,
[03:09.72]especially in cooking.
[03:11.67]But sometimes they have other uses.
[03:13.72]For example,
[03:15.34]oils are found in paint and in cleaning products,
[03:18.40]like soap.
[03:19.75]Oil is separated from seeds by using pressure.
[03:23.20]A machine called a press is often used.
[03:26.60]Sometimes it is surprising to learn how much oil the seeds contain.
[03:31.37]Sesame, cotton and sunflower seeds,
[03:34.08]for example, all contain at least 50% oil.
[03:37.72]Soybean is an important seed around the world,
[03:41.86]but it is only 20% oil.
[03:45.02]So chemicals are needed to release oil from soybeans.
[03:48.76]The first step in pressing the oil from seeds
[03:51.86]is to crush the seeds between two stones.
[03:54.81]A cloth container or bag is filled with the crushed seeds.
[03:59.07]Then the bag is hung up.
[04:01.14]Some of the oil will flow out of the bag and can be collected.
[04:04.65]But some oil will remain in the crushed seeds inside the bag.
[04:09.18]The easiest way to get the rest of the oil out
[04:11.43]is to place heavy rocks on the crushed material.
[04:14.32]Oil can also be collected with small,
[04:16.78]hand-operated machines.
[04:18.67]Small presses are important in areas
[04:21.32]where electricity or gasoline cannot be used.
[04:24.43]They are also a good way to test if a local market for oil exists.
[04:30.12]Questions 19 to 21 are based on the passage you have just heard.
[04:35.22]19. What use of oil is NOT mentioned in the passage?
[04:56.10]20. How much oil does soybean contain?
[05:15.88]21. Which of the following is the best title for the passage?
[05:36.82]Passage Three
[05:37.97]A new book by two professors at Pennsylvania State University
[05:42.28]compares public education systems around the world.
[05:45.47]The book is called National Differences,
[05:47.78]Global Similarities: World Culture and the Future of Schooling.
[05:51.33]David Baker and Gerald LeTendre led a group of researchers
[05:55.97]who gathered information on about 50 countries.
[05:58.28]Some findings came from the Third International Mathematics and Science Study.
[06:03.25]That study took place in 1994 and again five years later.
[06:07.94]The professors say education is increasingly shaped
[06:11.64]by what they call "transnational forces".
[06:14.21]Officials in many countries are concerned
[06:16.52]about how their students compare with students in other countries.
[06:19.61]Each part of the book develops a different subject
[06:22.71]researched in schools around the world.
[06:24.82]One of the subjects is violence among students.
[06:27.27]The professors say countries with the most school violence include Hungary,
[06:31.58]Romania and the Philippines.
[06:33.52]They say the United States is somewhere in the middle,
[06:36.48]above nations like New Zealand,
[06:38.68]Canada, South Korea, Spain and Australia.
[06:41.69]The findings are based on reports from students.
[06:44.70]Professor Baker says inequalities in educational systems act as an influence.
[06:50.05]He says schools that are sharply divided
[06:52.67]between "winners and losers" in math have higher levels of violence.
[06:56.63]"This does not mean that nations should stop trying to raise scores," he says.
[07:00.73]"But they should be careful to raise the performance among all students."
[07:05.12]Questions 22 to 25 are based on the passage you have just heard.
[07:10.72]22. What is the title of the book?
[07:30.17]23. What can we learn about the book from the passage?
[07:50.69]24. Where did the study find the most school violence?
[08:11.59]25. Which opinion would Professor Baker support?
[08:27.20]
