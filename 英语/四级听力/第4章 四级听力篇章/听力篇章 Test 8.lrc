[00:00.53]Section C
[00:02.76]Directions: In this section,
[00:05.81]you will hear three passages.
[00:08.21]At the end of each passage,
[00:10.68]you will hear some questions.
[00:13.04]Both the passage and the questions
[00:15.68]will be spoken only once.
[00:18.58]After you hear a question,
[00:20.98]you must choose the best answer from the four choices
[00:25.17]marked A), B), C) and D).
[00:29.23]Then mark the corresponding letter on Answer Sheet 1
[00:33.74]with a single line through the centre.
[00:37.78]Passage One
[00:39.84]As the new sales director for a national computer firm,
[00:44.63]Alex Gordon was looking forward to his first meeting
[00:47.97]with the company's district managers.
[00:50.37]Everyone arrived on time,
[00:52.82]and Alex's presentation went extremely well.
[00:56.61]He decided to end the meeting with the conversation
[01:00.27]about the importance of the district managers to the company's plans.
[01:05.42]"I believe we are going to continue
[01:08.57]to increase our share of the market," he began,
[01:12.10]"because of the quality of the people in this room.
[01:15.24]The district manager is the key to the success
[01:19.23]of the sales representatives in his district.
[01:22.65]He sets the term for everyone else.
[01:25.66]If he has ambitious goals and is willing to put in long hours,
[01:29.80]everyone in his unit will follow his example."
[01:35.14]When Alex was finished, he received polite applause,
[01:38.93]but hardly the warm response he had hoped for.
[01:43.20]Later he spoke with one of the senior managers.
[01:47.79]"Things were going so well until the end,"
[01:50.63]Alex said disappointedly.
[01:52.67]"Obviously, I said the wrong thing."
[01:55.43]"Yes," the district manager replied.
[02:00.01]"Half of our managers are women.
[02:02.53]Most have worked their way up from sales representatives,
[02:06.43]and they are very proud of the role
[02:08.03]they've played in the company's growth.
[02:10.18]They don't care at all about political correctness.
[02:14.27]But they were definitely surprised and distressed
[02:17.63]to be referred to as 'he' in your speech."
[02:21.52]Questions 16 to 19 are based on the passage you have just heard.
[02:27.96]16. Who did Alex Gordon speak to at the first meeting?
[02:48.61]17. What did Alex want to emphasize at the end of his presentation?
[03:09.72]18. What do we learn about the audience at the meeting?
[03:29.33]19. Why did Alex fail to receive the warm response he had hoped for?
[03:50.28]Passage Two
[03:52.83]The way to complain is to act business-like and important.
[03:56.99]If your complaint is immediate,
[03:59.81]suppose you got the wrong order at a restaurant,
[04:03.61]make a polite but firm request to see the manager.
[04:08.75]When the manager comes, ask his or her name.
[04:12.74]And then state your problem
[04:14.64]and what you expect to have done about it.
[04:17.39]Be polite!
[04:19.08]Shouting or acting rude will get you nowhere.
[04:22.93]But also be firm in making your complaint.
[04:28.39]Besides, act important.
[04:31.64]This doesn't mean to put on airs
[04:34.07]and say "do you know who I am?"
[04:36.77]What it means is that people are often treated the way
[04:41.18]they expect to be treated.
[04:43.43]If you act like someone who expects a fair request to be granted,
[04:47.88]chances are it will be granted.
[04:51.22]The worst way to complain is over the telephone.
[04:55.17]You are speaking to a voice coming from someone you cannot see.
[05:00.31]So you can't tell how the person on the line is reacting.
[05:04.95]It is easy for that person to give you the run-around.
[05:09.46]Complaining in person or by letter is generally more effective.
[05:15.96]If your complaint doesn't require an immediate response,
[05:20.30]it often helps to complain by letter.
[05:23.31]If you have an appliance that doesn't work,
[05:26.35]send a letter to the store that sold it.
[05:29.51]Be business-like and stick to the point.
[05:32.66]Don't spend a paragraph on how your uncle Joe
[05:36.45]tried to fix the problem and couldn't.
[05:40.29]Questions 20 to 22 are based on the passage you have just heard.
[05:46.77]20. What does the speaker suggest you do
[05:51.01]when you are not served properly at a restaurant?
[06:08.40]21. Why does the speaker say the worst way to complain
[06:14.08]is over the telephone?
[06:29.89]22. What should you do if you make a complaint by letter?
[06:49.91]Passage Three
[06:52.96]Barbara Sanders is a wife and the mother of two children,
[06:57.30]ages 2 and 4.
[06:59.90]Her husband, Tom, is an engineer and makes an excellent salary.
[07:05.30]Before Barbara had children,
[07:08.36]she worked as an architect for the government,
[07:11.36]designing government housing.
[07:14.06]She quit her job when she became pregnant,
[07:16.50]but is now interested in returning to work.
[07:20.40]She's been offered an excellent job with the government.
[07:24.04]Her husband feels it's unnecessary for her to work
[07:27.89]since the family does not need the added income.
[07:31.04]He also thinks that a woman should stay home with her children.
[07:35.64]If Barbara feels the need to do socially important work,
[07:39.73]he thinks that she should do volunteer work
[07:42.48]one or two days a week.
[07:44.60]Barbara, on the other hand,
[07:46.29]has missed the excitement of her profession
[07:49.19]and does not feel she would be satisfied doing volunteer work.
[07:53.34]She would also like to have her own income,
[07:56.18]so she does not have to ask her husband for money
[07:59.14]whenever she wants to buy something.
[08:01.60]She does not think it's necessary
[08:03.96]to stay home every day with the children
[08:06.31]and she knows a very reliable baby-sitter
[08:09.30]who's willing to come to her house.
[08:11.75]Tom does not think a baby-sitter can replace a mother
[08:15.30]and thinks it's a bad idea for the children
[08:18.36]to spend so much time with someone
[08:21.01]who's not part of the family.
[08:23.64]Questions 23 to 25 are based on the passage you have just heard.
[08:30.28]23. What was Barbara's profession before she had children?
[08:50.82]24. What does Barbara's husband suggest she do
[08:55.87]if she wants to work?
[09:11.91]25. What does Tom think about hiring a baby-sitter?
[09:28.26]
