[00:01.06]Section C
[00:02.52]Directions: In this section,
[00:06.11]you will hear three passages.
[00:08.15]At the end of each passage,
[00:09.75]you will hear some questions.
[00:11.76]Both the passage and the questions
[00:13.65]will be spoken only once.
[00:16.06]After you hear a question,
[00:17.66]you must choose the best answer from the four choices
[00:20.92]marked A), B), C) and D).
[00:24.71]Then mark the corresponding letter on Answer Sheet 1
[00:28.47]with a single line through the centre.
[00:31.80]Passage One
[00:33.45]The space shuttle Discovery has safely returned to earth
[00:37.49]after 2 weeks in earth's orbit.
[00:39.30]Discovery commander Eileen Collins guided the shuttle
[00:42.39]to an easy landing at Edwards Air Force Base
[00:44.79]in California early Tuesday.
[00:47.21]American Space Agency officials described Discovery's trip
[00:50.71]as wildly successful.
[00:52.40]But they refused to say when the shuttle may fly again.
[00:55.62]The Space Agency has suspended all future shuttle flights
[00:59.87]until it can discover why a piece of hard protective material
[01:03.02]broke off from Discovery.
[01:04.98]A similar incident damaged the Columbia space shuttle in 2003.
[01:09.12]Columbia was destroyed as it reentered earth's atmosphere.
[01:12.44]Japan has marked the 60th anniversary
[01:15.68]of the atomic bomb attack on the city of Nagasaki.
[01:18.26]The American bombings of Nagasaki and Hiroshima
[01:21.12]ended World War II.
[01:22.62]Nagasaki Mayor Iccho Itoh called for a world ban on nuclear weapons.
[01:27.83]He urged Americans to ask
[01:29.87]if the United States needs thousands of nuclear arms
[01:32.37]to guarantee its security.
[01:34.34]A short time later, Prime Minister Junichiro Koizumi said
[01:38.25]he would work to keep Japan free of nuclear weapons.
[01:41.66]In Cambodia, an opposition politician has been sentenced to 7 years
[01:46.66]in prison for plotting to overthrow the government.
[01:49.31]Cheam Channy was arrested in February
[01:51.61]after the National Assembly canceled his parliamentary protection
[01:54.61]from legal charges.
[01:56.60]He denies any wrongdoing.
[01:58.05]A court found Cheam Channy
[02:00.21]and opposition member Khom Peseth guilty.
[02:03.26]Khom Peseth received a 5-year prison sentence.
[02:07.16]Briefly, here again is the major news of the hour.
[02:10.70]The American space shuttle Discovery has safely returned to earth.
[02:14.55]Japan has marked the 60th anniversary
[02:17.40]of the atomic bomb attack on Nagasaki.
[02:19.67]And in Cambodia, an opposition politician has been sentenced
[02:23.51]to 7 years in prison for plotting to overthrow the government.
[02:29.02]Questions 16 to 18 are based on the passage you have just heard.
[02:34.26]16. How did American Space Agency officials describe Discovery's trip?
[02:57.57]17. What did Nagasaki Mayor call for?
[03:18.29]18. What was the charge against the two opposition politicians?
[03:38.59]Passage Two
[03:40.93]Unlike most of the other holidays,
[03:43.43]the history of April Fool's Day is not totally clear.
[03:47.59]The closest point in time that can be identified
[03:51.41]as the beginning of this tradition was in 1582, in France.
[03:56.51]Before that year,
[03:58.10]the new year was celebrated for eight days,
[04:00.77]beginning on March 25 and lasting until April 1.
[04:05.05]With the reform of the calendar under Charles IX,
[04:08.58]a new calendar was introduced,
[04:10.95]and New Year's Day was moved to January 1.
[04:14.46]However, many people did not receive the news
[04:18.20]or refused to accept the new calendar
[04:21.05]and continued to celebrate the new year on April 1.
[04:25.38]These backward folk were labeled as "fools"
[04:28.83]by the general public.
[04:30.88]They were often sent on "fool's errands"
[04:33.49]or were made the target of other practical jokes.
[04:37.19]This evolved, over time,
[04:39.94]into a tradition of joke-playing on the first day of April.
[04:43.58]The tradition eventually spread to England and Scotland
[04:48.23]in the 18th century.
[04:50.08]It was later introduced to the American colonies
[04:52.92]of both the English and French.
[04:55.06]Jokes performed on April Fool's Day range from the simple
[04:59.37](such as saying, "Your shoe's untied!"), to the elaborate.
[05:03.50]Setting a room-mate's alarm clock back an hour is a common trick.
[05:07.94]Whatever the joke,
[05:09.55]the trickster usually ends it by yelling to his victim,
[05:12.79]"April Fool!" Practical jokes are a common practice on April Fool's Day.
[05:18.29]Sometimes, elaborate practical jokes are played on friends or relatives
[05:22.90]that last the entire day.
[05:24.95]The news media even gets involved.
[05:28.30]For instance, a British short film once shown on April Fool's Day
[05:32.25]was a fairly detailed documentary about "noodle farmers"
[05:36.31]and how they harvest their crop from the noodle trees.
[05:39.55]April Fool's Day is a "for-fun-only" celebration.
[05:44.50]Nobody is expected to buy gifts or to take their "significant other"
[05:49.65]out to eat in a fancy restaurant.
[05:51.90]Nobody gets off work or school.
[05:54.81]It's simply a fun little holiday,
[05:57.61]but a holiday on which one must remain forever alert,
[06:00.99]for he may be the next April Fool!
[06:04.94]Questions 19 to 21 are based on the passage you have just heard.
[06:10.06]19. When was the new year celebrated in France before 1582?
[06:31.97]20. When did the tradition of April Fool's Day spread to England?
[06:51.90]21. What do we know from the passage?
[07:11.14]Passage Three
[07:14.59]Charlie Parker is one of America's greatest jazz musicians.
[07:17.69]He influenced the direction of jazz music during his short lifetime.
[07:21.89]He developed a new style of jazz called bebop.
[07:24.85]Performers of bebop left the traditional musical melody
[07:28.31]and played a song freely,
[07:29.81]with the music and rhythm that was felt at the time.
[07:32.48]So, the same song could be played in a different way
[07:35.22]each time it was performed.
[07:37.17]Charlie Parker was born in 1920
[07:39.47]and had his first saxophone in 1933.
[07:42.56]Charlie developed as a musician
[07:44.83]by playing with different groups in public eating
[07:47.47]and drinking places called nightclubs.
[07:49.62]Meanwhile, Charlie developed serious problems
[07:52.10]that were to affect him the rest of his life.
[07:54.49]He became dependent on alcohol and the illegal drug, heroin.
[07:59.25]In 1939, Charlie went to New York City,
[08:02.20]where he began to develop his own style of jazz.
[08:05.45]Charlie Parker's name first appeared
[08:07.49]in the press reports about music in 1940.
[08:10.24]During the next five years,
[08:12.01]he joined different bands.
[08:13.55]He apparently did not feel at ease playing with a big band,
[08:16.91]so he returned to New York City in 1947.
[08:19.60]The following four years are considered his most successful.
[08:24.21]He formed his own small bands and played with other groups.
[08:28.15]He visited Europe three times,
[08:29.96]where he recorded about half of the albums he ever made.
[08:32.85]His last public appearance was on March 5th, 1955, at Birdland.
[08:38.06]It was not a success.
[08:39.56]He died seven days later of a heart attack.
[08:43.29]Questions 22 to 25 are based on the passage you have just heard.
[08:49.65]22. What is the passage mainly about?
[09:10.79]23. Which of the following is true about Charlie's music style?
[09:32.22]24. Which of the following is considered one of Charlie's most successful years?
[09:54.42]25. Where did he record about half of the albums he ever made?
[10:12.40]
