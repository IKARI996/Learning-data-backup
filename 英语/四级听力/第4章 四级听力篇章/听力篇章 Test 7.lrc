[00:01.06]Section C
[00:02.52]Directions: In this section,
[00:06.11]you will hear three passages.
[00:08.15]At the end of each passage,
[00:09.75]you will hear some questions.
[00:11.76]Both the passage and the questions
[00:13.65]will be spoken only once.
[00:16.06]After you hear a question,
[00:17.66]you must choose the best answer from the four choices
[00:20.92]marked A), B), C) and D).
[00:24.71]Then mark the corresponding letter on Answer Sheet 1
[00:28.47]with a single line through the centre.
[00:32.14]Passage One
[00:34.22]There are many commonly held beliefs about eye glasses 
[00:38.95]and eyesight that are not proven facts.
[00:42.55]For instance, some people believe that
[00:44.85]wearing glasses too soon weakens the eyes.
[00:48.50]But there is no evidence to show that
[00:51.55]the structure of eyes is changed by wearing glasses at a young age.
[00:57.38]Wearing the wrong glasses, however, can prove harmful.
[01:01.93]Studies show that for adults there is no danger,
[01:05.37]but children can develop loss of vision
[01:08.12]if they have glasses inappropriate for their eyes.
[01:12.39]We have all heard some of the common myths
[01:16.40]about how eyesight gets bad.
[01:19.14]Most people believe that reading in dim light causes poor eyesight,
[01:24.44]but that is untrue.
[01:26.94]Too little light makes the eyes work harder,
[01:30.37]so they do get tired and strained.
[01:33.05]Eyestrain also results from reading a lot,
[01:36.74]reading in bed, and watching too much television.
[01:40.31]However, although eyestrain may cause some pain or headaches,
[01:45.43]it does not permanently damage eyesight.
[01:48.88]Another myth about eyes is that they can be replaced,
[01:53.56]or transferred from one person to another.
[01:56.82]There are close to one million nerve fibres that
[01:59.92]connect the eyeball to the brain,
[02:03.02]as of yet it is impossible to attach them all in a new person.
[02:08.16]Only certain parts of the eye can be replaced.
[02:12.07]But if we keep clearing up the myths and
[02:14.82]learning more about the eyes,
[02:17.12]some day a full transplant may be possible.
[02:21.07]Questions 16 to 18 are based on the passage you have just heard.
[02:26.42]16. What does the speaker want to tell us about eyesight?
[02:46.50]17. What do studies about wearing the wrong glasses show?
[03:06.17]18. What do we learn about eye transplanting from the talk?
[03:26.26]Passage Two
[03:28.87]When people care for an elderly relative,
[03:31.72]they often do not use available community services
[03:35.57]such as adult daycare centers.
[03:37.91]If the caregivers are adult children,
[03:40.71]they are more likely to use such services,
[03:43.76]especially because they often have jobs and other responsibilities.
[03:48.50]In contrast, a spouse, usually the wife,
[03:52.69]is much less likely to use support services or
[03:56.48]to put the dependent person in a nursing home.
[03:59.34]Social workers discover that the wife normally tries to
[04:03.74]take care of her husband herself for as long as
[04:07.13]she can in order not to use up their life savings.
[04:11.13]Researchers have found that caring for the elderly
[04:14.73]can be a very positive experience.
[04:17.62]The elderly appreciated the care and attention they received.
[04:21.35]They were affectionate and cooperative.
[04:24.17]However, even when care-giving is satisfying, it is hard work.
[04:29.72]Social workers and experts on aging offer caregivers
[04:33.72]and potential caregivers help when arranging for
[04:36.65]the care of an elderly relative.
[04:39.66]One consideration is to ask parents what
[04:42.55]they want before they become sick or dependent.
[04:46.55]Perhaps they prefer going into a nursing home and
[04:49.74]can select one in advance.
[04:52.24]On the other hand, they may want to live with their adult children.
[04:56.39]Caregivers must also learn to state their needs and
[05:03.39]opinions clearly and ask for help from others
[05:03.68]especially brothers and sisters.
[05:06.14]Brothers and sisters are often willing to help,
[05:08.93]but they may not know what to do.
[05:11.83]Questions 19 to 21 are based on the passage you have just heard.
[05:18.27]19. Why are adult children more likely to
[05:23.42]use community services to help care for elderly parents?
[05:42.20]20. Why are most wives unwilling to
[05:46.30]put their dependent husbands into nursing homes?
[06:03.94]21. According to the passage, what must caregivers learn to do?
[06:23.98]Passage Three
[06:26.24]Since a union representative visited our company to
[06:31.03]inform us about our rights and protections,
[06:34.07]my coworkers have been worrying about health conditions and
[06:38.32]complaining about safety hazards in the workplace.
[06:42.82]Several of the employees in the computer department,
[06:45.88]for example, claim to be developing vision problems
[06:50.15]from having to stare at a video display terminal
[06:53.16]for about 7 hours a day.
[06:55.91]The supervisor of the laboratory is beginning to
[06:59.50]get headaches and dizzy spells because she says it's dangerous to
[07:04.36]breathe some of the chemical smoke there.
[07:08.00]An X-ray technician is refusing to do
[07:10.60]her job until the firm agrees to replace its out-dated equipment.
[07:16.34]She insists that it's exposing workers to
[07:19.93]unnecessarily high doses of radiation.
[07:23.85]She thinks that she may have to contact the Occupational Safety and
[07:27.39]Health Administration and ask that
[07:30.34]government agency to inspect the department.
[07:33.66]I've heard that at a factory in the area,
[07:37.25]two pregnant women who were working with
[07:39.85]paint, requested a transfer to a safer department,
[07:44.05]because they wanted to prevent damage to their unborn babies.
[07:48.66]The supervisor of personnel refused the request.
[07:52.31]In another firm the workers were constantly complaining
[07:57.06]about the malfunctioning heating system,
[07:59.72]but the owner was too busy or too mean to do anything about it.
[08:05.06]Finally, they all met and
[08:07.41]agreed to wear ski-clothing to work the next day.
[08:11.21]The owner was too embarrassed to talk to his employees.
[08:14.72]But he had the heating system replaced right away.
[08:19.01]Questions 22 to 25 are based on the passage you have just heard.
[08:25.52]22. What does the talk focus on?
[08:44.62]23. What did an X-ray technician ask her company to do?
[09:04.85]24. What does the speaker say about
[09:09.35]the two pregnant women working with paint?
[09:25.98]25. Why did the workers in the firm wear ski-clothing to work?
[09:41.84]
