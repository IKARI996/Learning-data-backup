[00:00.53]Section C
[00:02.76]Directions: In this section,
[00:05.81]you will hear three passages.
[00:08.21]At the end of each passage,
[00:10.68]you will hear some questions.
[00:13.04]Both the passage and the questions
[00:15.68]will be spoken only once.
[00:18.58]After you hear a question,
[00:20.98]you must choose the best answer from the four choices
[00:25.17]marked A), B), C) and D).
[00:29.23]Then mark the corresponding letter on Answer Sheet 1
[00:33.74]with a single line through the centre.
[00:37.76]Passage One
[00:39.96]While Gail Opp-Kemp,
[00:41.67]an American artist was giving a speech on the art of Japanese brush painting
[00:46.47]to an audience that included visitors from Japan,
[00:49.02]she was confused to see
[00:51.42]that many of her Japanese listeners have their eyes closed.
[00:55.11]Were they tuned off because an American had the nerve
[00:58.23]to instruct Japanese in their own art form
[01:01.13]or they deliberately trying to signal their rejection of her?
[01:06.10]Opp-Kemp later found out that her listeners were not being disrespectful.
[01:12.23]Japanese listeners sometimes close their eyes to enhance concentration.
[01:17.53]Her listeners were showing their respect for her by chewing on her words.
[01:23.99]Someday you may be either a speaker or a listener
[01:28.09]in a situation involving people from other countries
[01:31.53]or members of a minority group in North America.
[01:35.49]Learning how different cultures signal respect
[01:38.56]can help you avoid misunderstandings.
[01:41.86]Here are some examples.
[01:44.08]In the Deaf culture of North America,
[01:46.89]many listeners show applause not by clapping their hands
[01:51.37]but by waving them in the air.
[01:53.72]In some cultures,
[01:55.23]both overseas and in some minority groups in North America,
[01:59.38]listeners are considered disrespectful
[02:02.08]if they look directly at the speaker.
[02:04.99]Respect is shown by looking in the general direction
[02:09.04]but avoiding direct eye contact.
[02:12.42]In some countries,
[02:14.67]whistling by listeners is a sign of approval
[02:18.13]while in other countries it is a form of insult.
[02:23.12]Questions 16 to 18 are based on the passage you have just heard.
[02:28.92]16. What did Opp-Kemp's speech focus on?
[02:48.05]17. Why do Japanese listeners sometimes close their eyes
[02:54.14]while listening to a speech?
[03:11.32]18. What does the speaker try to explain?
[03:28.67]Passage Two
[03:30.91]Chris is in charge of purchasing and maintaining equipment
[03:34.16]in his division at Taxalong Company.
[03:37.42]He's soon going to have an evaluation interview
[03:40.55]with his supervisor and the personnel director
[03:43.28]to discuss the work he has done in the past year.
[03:46.60]Salary, promotion and plans for the coming year will also be discussed
[03:50.86]at the meeting.
[03:51.91]Chris has made several changes for his division in the past year.
[03:56.15]First, he bought new equipment for one of the departments.
[03:59.90]He has been particularly happy about the new equipment
[04:03.26]because many of the employees have told him
[04:05.89]how much it has helped them.
[04:07.63]Along with improving the equipment,
[04:09.78]Chris began a program to train employees
[04:13.10]to use equipment better and do simple maintenance themselves.
[04:18.07]The training saves time for the employees and money for the company.
[04:22.11]Unfortunately, one serious problem developed during the year.
[04:26.96]Two employees that Chris hired were stealing, and he had to fire them.
[04:32.36]Chris knows that a new job for a purchasing and maintenance manager
[04:36.12]for the whole company will be open in a few months,
[04:39.47]and he would like to be promoted to the job.
[04:42.12]Chris knows, however, that someone else wants the new job, too.
[04:46.02]Kim is in charge of purchasing and maintenance
[04:49.34]in another division of the company.
[04:51.10]She has also made several changes over the year.
[04:54.39]Chris knows that his boss likes Kim's work,
[04:56.89]and expects that his work will be compared with hers.
[05:00.88]Questions19 to 22 are based on the passage you have just heard.
[05:06.83]19. What is Chris's main responsibility at Taxalong Company?
[05:27.93]20. What problem did Chris encounter in his division?
[05:48.14]21. What does Chris hope for in the near future?
[06:07.74]22. What do we learn about Kim from the passage?
[06:26.75]Passage Three
[06:28.70]Proverbs, sometimes called sayings, are examples of folk wisdom.
[06:36.29]They are little lessons
[06:37.62]which older people of a culture pass down to the younger people
[06:41.16]to teach them about life.
[06:43.26]Many proverbs remind people of the values
[06:46.23]that are important in the culture.
[06:48.54]Values teach people how to act, what is right, and what is wrong.
[06:54.17]Because the values of each culture are different,
[06:57.62]understanding the values of another culture helps explain
[07:01.52]how people think and act.
[07:04.57]Understanding your own cultural values is important too.
[07:09.12]If you can accept that people from other cultures act
[07:12.21]according to their values, not yours,
[07:15.40]getting along with them will be much easier.
[07:18.61]Many proverbs are very old.
[07:22.02]So some of the values they teach may not be as important
[07:25.92]in the culture as they once were.
[07:28.52]For example,
[07:30.01]Americans today do not pay much attention to the proverb
[07:33.80]"Haste makes waste",
[07:36.55]because patience is not important to them.
[07:39.51]But if you know about past values,
[07:42.10]it helps you to understand the present.
[07:44.87]And many of the older values are still strong today.
[07:49.06]Benjamin Franklin,
[07:50.86]a famous American diplomat, writer, and scientist,
[07:54.92]died in 1790,
[07:56.92]but his proverb "Time is money" is taken more seriously
[08:01.71]by Americans of today than ever before.
[08:05.55]A study of proverbs from around the world shows
[08:09.05]that some values are shared by many cultures.
[08:13.15]In many cases, though, the same idea is expressed differently.
[08:19.44]Questions 23 to 25 are based on the passage you have just heard.
[08:26.42]23. Why are proverbs so important?
[08:45.63]24. According to the speaker,
[08:48.73]what happens to some proverbs with the passage of time?
[09:06.27]25. What do we learn from the study of proverbs from around the world?
[09:23.59]
