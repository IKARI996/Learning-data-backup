[00:00.00]Most students in the UK leave school or sixth-form college
[00:03.56]at the age of 18 and go to study for three years in a University,
[00:07.27]but in recent years many students have chosen
[00:10.12]to take a one-year break between finishing school
[00:12.67]and starting university.
[00:14.44]This period is called a gap year
[00:16.73]and is a time when British students can broaden their horizons
[00:20.50]by visiting foreign countries.
