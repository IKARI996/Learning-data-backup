[00:00.00]It's another day of stringent security checks
[00:02.91]at Tel Aviv's Ben Gurion airport.
[00:05.62]About a million passengers pass through the airport
[00:08.44]each month, on average.
[00:11.36]But here, the lines move quickly
[00:13.35]thanks to what Israeli security experts say is an approach
[00:16.56]that - unlike other countries
[00:18.08]- relies more on eye contact with passengers
[00:20.89]and less on technology.
