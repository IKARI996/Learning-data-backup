[00:00.56]Section B
[00:02.23]Directions: In this section,
[00:04.60]you will hear two long conversations.
[00:07.30]At the end of each conversation,
[00:09.00]you will hear four questions.
[00:11.47]Both the conversation and the questions
[00:13.41]will be spoken only once.
[00:15.88]After you hear a question,
[00:17.32]you must choose the best answer
[00:19.28]from the four choices marked A), B), C) and D).
[00:24.98]Then mark the corresponding letter on Answer Sheet 1
[00:28.13]with a single line through the centre.
[00:31.40]Conversation One
[00:33.72]W: What are you doing?
[00:35.13]M: I'm ordering some filing cabinets out of a catalog.
[00:38.08]W: What do you need them for?
[00:39.68]M: There's so much stuff piling up in my dormitory room.
[00:42.43]If I don't do something soon,
[00:43.77]I won't be able to move in there.
[00:45.92]W: Do you usually order from a catalog?
[00:48.29]M: Sometimes. Why?
[00:49.93]W: Oh, it's just in the history class today
[00:52.63]we were talking about how the catalog
[00:54.38]sales business first got started in the US.
[00:57.77]A Chicago retailer, Montgomery Ward started it in the late 1800s.
[01:02.84]It was really popular among farmers.
[01:05.69]It was difficult for them to make it to the big city stores
[01:08.62]so they ordered from catalogs.
[01:11.17]M: Was Ward the only one in the business?
[01:13.32]W: At first, but another person named Richard Sears
[01:16.97]started his own catalog after he heard how much money Ward was making.
[01:21.72]M: What made them so popular?
[01:24.17]W: Farmers trusted Ward and Sears for one thing.
[01:27.17]They delivered the products the farmers paid for
[01:29.74]and even refunded the price of things the farmers weren't satisfied with.
[01:34.28]The catalogs became so popular
[01:36.23]that in some countries school teachers even used them as textbooks.
[01:40.63]M: Textbooks?
[01:41.63]W: Yeah, students practice spelling the names
[01:44.53]and adding up the prices of things in the catalogs.
[01:47.68]M: Was everybody that thrilled about it?
[01:49.98]W: That's doubtful.
[01:51.73]Say they drove some small store owners out of business.
[01:55.44]Sears and Ward sold stuff in such large quantities.
[01:58.84]They were able to undercut the prices
[02:00.98]at some small family owned stores.
[02:04.34]Questions 8 to 11 are based on the conversation you have just heard.
[02:11.35]8. What is the conversation mainly about?
[02:30.51]9. Why did Richard Sears start his own business in catalog?
[02:51.17]10. Who were the main customers of Sears and Ward’s business?
[03:11.86]11. Why was the catalog used as textbooks?
[03:31.88]Conversation Two
[03:34.08]W: Did you go to the match on Saturday, Bill?
[03:36.37]M: No, Alice.
[03:37.44]I listened to the commentary instead.
[03:39.34]It sounded pretty exciting, I must say.
[03:41.54]W: You must be joking.
[03:43.18]Well, it was pretty dull really.
[03:45.18]M: How did it go then?
[03:46.79]I should have thought the Gunners did well
[03:48.13]to win over the Wolves in their present form.
[03:50.52]W: Yes, I suppose they did.
[03:52.58]But two-one didn't do them justice.
[03:55.33]They should have had at least three in the first half,
[03:57.69]and another two in the second.
[03:59.84]How far do you think the Wolves will go?
[04:02.49]M: I suppose it all depends on how they shape after Christmas.
[04:05.38]Remember what happened last year?
[04:07.03]W: I'll say I do.
[04:08.19]I'm not likely to forget it.
[04:10.29]I've never seen such a shame.
[04:12.39]To think they were in the top three for most of the time before Christmas,
[04:16.34]and then the way they came down.
[04:18.15]I just don't understand what came over them.
[04:20.35]I can't understand.
[04:22.20]M: I don't know, either.
[04:23.51]Can you really say that?
[04:24.96]Because they were quite O.K. until Blake got injured,
[04:27.56]and then without his influence in the attack
[04:29.41]they just couldn't score goals any more.
[04:31.26]I think it was simply a matter of the attack being weakened.
[04:35.00]Questions 12 to 15 are based on the conversation you have just heard.
[04:41.61]12. What is true of Saturday’s match?
[05:00.53]13. How many goals does Alice think the Gunners should have scored?
[05:21.18]14. What decides the Wolves’ future according to the man?
[05:41.28]15. What happened to the Wolves that made it come down?
[05:59.61]
