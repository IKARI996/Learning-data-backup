[00:02.23]Directions: In this section,
[00:04.60]you will hear two long conversations.
[00:07.30]At the end of each conversation,
[00:09.00]you will hear four questions.
[00:11.47]Both the conversation and the questions
[00:13.41]will be spoken only once.
[00:15.88]After you hear a question,
[00:17.32]you must choose the best answer
[00:19.28]from the four choices marked A), B), C) and D).
[00:24.98]Then mark the corresponding letter on Answer Sheet 1

[00:31.53]Conversation One
[00:33.22]W: Hello. Can I take your order?
[00:35.22]M: Yes. I'd like a large pepperoni pizza
[00:38.20]with mushrooms and green peppers.
[00:40.10]Uh, can I make that a half-and-half pizza?
[00:42.70]W: Sure. What would you like on each half?
[00:44.65]We have Italian sausage, ham, mushrooms,
[00:47.32]onions, pineapple, green peppers, bacon and tomatoes.
[00:51.33]M: I'll have pineapple and mushrooms on one half
[00:53.62]and green peppers and Italian sausage on the other.
[00:56.13]Oh, and could I get extra cheese on that pizza?
[00:58.47]W: Alright. Would you care for any bread sticks
[01:00.98]or beverage with your order?
[01:02.43]Actually, we have a Friday night family special going on right now,
[01:06.14]and if you order any large pizza and drink,
[01:09.15]we'll throw in a free order of bread sticks,
[01:11.70]plus a three-dollar coupon for use with your next pizza order.
[01:15.40]M: Huh, sure, why not? And what drink comes with the pizza?
[01:18.71]W: Either apple or orange juice.
[01:20.93]M: I'll take orange juice.
[01:22.33]W: Okay. Your total comes to fifteen nineteen,
[01:25.75]which includes tax.
[01:27.54]And could I have your name,
[01:28.95]address and telephone number?
[01:30.82]M: Uh, yeah, Jay Smith.
[01:32.43]It's 1340 South 16 East,
[01:35.60]and the phone number is 340-1870.
[01:41.24]Questions 8 to 11 are based on the conversation you have just heard.
[01:46.42]8. What is available from this pizza shop?

[03:07.64]Conversation Two
[03:10.28]W: Good morning, Mr. Pitt. Do sit down.
[03:12.43]M: Thank you.
[03:13.59]W: First of all, Mr. Pitt,
[03:14.99]I'd like you to tell me a bit about what you've been doing.
[03:17.99]M: Well, I took four subjects in school:
[03:20.40]French, German, Chemistry and, uh, Art.
[03:24.19]Chemistry wasn't my cup of tea but Art has always been.
[03:27.63]W: Art?
[03:28.29]M: Well, I really wanted to study Art.
[03:31.09]It didn't turn out like that because a friend of my father's offered me a job
[03:34.69]―he's an accountant in London.
[03:36.33]A quite big firm, you know.
[03:37.88]W: I see. A firm of accountants.
[03:40.18]Interesting! In your application,
[03:42.73]you say that you only spent nine months with this firm of accountants.
[03:46.63]Why was that?
[03:47.93]M: It was nearly a year actually.
[03:49.83]Well, to be quite honest,
[03:51.69]I didn't like it.
[03:52.77]I just couldn't seem to get interested in the job
[03:55.12]although there were fairly good prospects.
[03:56.97]So I got a place at the Art College to do a three-year diploma course.
[04:00.68]W: I see. Now, Mr. Pitt,
[04:02.73]what about hobbies and interests?
[04:04.48]Uh, what do you do in your spare time?
[04:06.52]M: I like jazz, traditional and folk music.
[04:09.54]I don't play, of course,
[04:10.95]but I go to quite a lot of concerts,
[04:12.70]and I go to the theatre occasionally and act a bit myself.
[04:16.05]I'm in the local dramatic society.
[04:18.20]I read quite a lot and I've done a bit of photography.
[04:21.00]Also, I've traveled a lot-hitchhiked all over Europe-last year, that was...
[04:25.70]W: Very interesting, Mr. Pitt.
[04:27.09]I think that's all I wanted to ask about your background.
[04:31.55]Questions 12 to 15 are based on the conversation you have just heard.
[04:36.72]12. What might be the relationship between the woman and the man?
[04:56.96]13. Why didn’t Mr. Pitt study Art immediately after he left school?
[05:18.75]14. How long did it take the man to get a diploma at the Art College?
[05:39.93]15. Which is one of the things Mr. Pitt does in his spare time?
[05:59.17]
