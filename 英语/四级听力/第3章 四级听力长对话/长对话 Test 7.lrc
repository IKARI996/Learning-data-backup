[00:01.09]Section B
[00:03.35]Directions: In this section,
[00:06.54]you will hear two long conversations.
[00:10.14]At the end of each conversation,
[00:12.34]you will hear four questions.
[00:14.99]Both the conversation and the questions
[00:18.09]will be spoken only once.
[00:20.96]After you hear a question,
[00:22.92]you must choose the best answer
[00:25.48]from the four choices marked A), B), C) and D).
[00:31.43]Then mark the corresponding letter on Answer Sheet 1
[00:35.63]with a single line through the centre.
[00:39.72]Conversation One
[00:43.06]M: Hello, Professor Johnson.
[00:44.60]W: Hello, Tony, so what shall we work on today?
[00:48.10]M: Well, the problem is that this
[00:50.34]writing assignment isn't coming out right.
[00:53.48]What I thought I was writing on was to talk about
[00:56.75]what a particular sport means to me when I participate in.
[01:02.23]W: What sport did you choose?
[01:04.53]M: I decided to write about cross-country skiing.
[01:08.63]W: What are you going to say about skiing?
[01:11.48]M: That's the problem.
[01:13.19]I thought I would write about how peaceful it is to be out in the country.
[01:18.04]W: So why is that a problem?
[01:20.24]M: As I start describing how quiet it is to be out in the woods,
[01:24.80]I keep mentioning how much effort it takes to keep going.
[01:29.01]Cross-country skiing isn't as easy as some people think.
[01:33.31]It takes a lot of energy, but that's not part of my paper,
[01:37.64]so I guess I should leave it out.
[01:39.80]But now I don't know how to explain that
[01:42.39]feeling of peacefulness without explaining
[01:45.16]how hard you have to work for it.
[01:47.43]It all fits together.
[01:49.33]It's not like just sitting down somewhere
[01:52.23]and watching the clouds roll by.
[01:54.14]That's different.
[01:55.89]W: Then you have to include that in your point.
[01:59.79]The peacefulness of cross-country skiing is the kind you earn by effort.
[02:05.32]Why leave that out?
[02:07.20]Part of your point you knew beforehand,
[02:10.15]but part you discovered as you wrote.
[02:12.51]That's common, right?
[02:14.22]M: Yeah, I guess so.
[02:17.71]Questions 8 to 11 are based on the conversation you have just heard.
[02:25.44]8. What is the topic of the man’s writing assignment?
[02:45.48]9. What problem does the man have while working on his paper?
[03:06.36]10. What is mentioned by the man
[03:09.97]as different from cross-country skiing?
[03:27.62]11. What does the woman say is common in writing papers?
[03:47.99]Conversation Two
[03:52.06]W: Good evening and welcome to this week's Business World,
[03:56.37]a program for and about business people.
[04:00.32]Tonight we have Mr. Angeleno who
[04:02.62]came to the United States six years ago,
[04:05.63]and is now an established businessman with three restaurants in town.
[04:10.53]Tell us Mr. Angeleno, how did you get started?
[04:14.89]M: Well, I started off with a small diner.
[04:18.00]I did all the cooking myself and my wife waited on tables.
[04:22.59]It was really too much work for two people.
[04:25.71]My cooking is great, and word got around town about the food.
[04:30.60]Within a year, I had to hire another cook and four waitresses.
[04:35.20]When that restaurant became very busy, I decided to expand my business.
[04:41.41]Now with three places, my main concern is keeping
[04:45.56]the business successful and running smoothly.
[04:48.86]W: Do you advertise?
[04:50.45]M: Oh yes. I don't have any TV commercials,
[04:53.62]because they are too expensive.
[04:56.33]But I advertise a lot on radio and in local newspapers.
[05:00.77]My children used to distribute ads in nearby shopping centers,
[05:05.09]but we don't need to do that anymore.
[05:07.90]W: Why do you believe you've been so successful?
[05:10.89]M: Em, I always serve the freshest possible food and
[05:15.64]I make the atmosphere as comfortable and as pleasant as I can,
[05:19.93]so that my customers would want to come back.
[05:22.85]W: So you always aim to please the customers?
[05:25.94]M: Absolutely! Without them I would have no business at all.
[05:30.64]W: Thank you, Mr. Angeleno.
[05:32.84]I think your advice will be helpful to those just starting out in business.
[05:39.99]Questions 12 to 15 are based on the conversation you have just heard.
[05:48.05]12. What is the woman’s occupation?
[06:06.53]13. What do we learn about Mr. Angeleno’s business at its beginning?
[06:27.40]14. What does Mr. Angeleno say about advertising his business?
[06:48.50]15. What does the man say contributes to the success of his business?
