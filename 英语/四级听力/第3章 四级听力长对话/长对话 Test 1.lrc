[00:36.19]M: Yes, I'd like to make an appointment to see Dr. Carter, please.
[00:39.91]This is my first visit and my name is Ronald Schuller.
[00:43.57]W: And may I ask who referred you to our office?
[00:46.63]M: Uh, I drove past your office yesterday.
[00:49.23]W: Okay. How about the day after tomorrow
[00:52.19]on Wednesday at 4:00 o'clock?
[00:54.34]M: Uh. Do you happen to have an opening in the morning?
[00:57.11]I usually pick up my kids from school around that time.
[01:00.20]W: Okay. Um...
[01:01.52]how about Tuesday at 8:00 A.M.
[01:03.42]or Thursday at 8:15 A.M.?
[01:05.82]M: Well, in that case, Thursday would be fine.
[01:09.29]And my phone number is 643-0547.
[01:14.05]W: Alright. And what's the nature of your visit?
[01:17.62]M: Well, to tell the truth,
[01:19.13]I fell from a ladder two days ago while painting my house,
[01:21.98]and I sprained my ankle when my foot landed in a paint can.
[01:25.45]I'm most concerned that the swelling in my ankle
[01:27.64]hasn't gone down yet.
[01:28.80]Uh, the paint can is still on my foot.
[01:32.06]W: Look, Mr. Schuller.

[03:08.20]And how's your new apartment working out?
[03:10.45]W: Well, that's what I'm calling about.
[03:12.50]You see, I've decided to look for a new place.
[03:15.31]M: Oh, what's the problem with your place now?
[03:17.32]I thought you liked the apartment.
[03:19.02]W: Oh, I do,
[03:19.74]but it's a little far from campus,
[03:21.74]and the commute is just killing me.
[03:24.00]Do you think you could help?
[03:25.81]I thought you might know more
[03:27.41]about the housing situation near the university.
[03:29.96]M: Alright.
[03:30.77]So, what kind of place are you looking for?
[03:33.02]W: Well, I'd like to share an apartment with one or two roommates
[03:36.61]within walking distance to school.
[03:39.42]M: Okay, what's your budget like?
[03:41.62]I mean how much do you want to spend on rent?
[03:44.38]W: Uh, somewhere under $200 a month,
[03:47.68]including utilities, if I could. Oh,
[03:50.47]and I'd prefer to rent a furnished apartment.
[03:53.48]M: Hmm. And anything else?
[03:55.79]W: Yeah, I need a parking space.
[03:58.04]M: Well, I know there's an apartment complex around the corner
[04:00.73]that seems to have a few vacancies.
[04:02.93]I'll drop by there on my way to class today.
