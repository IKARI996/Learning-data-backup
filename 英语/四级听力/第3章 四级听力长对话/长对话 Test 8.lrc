[00:00.56]Section B
[00:02.23]Directions: In this section,
[00:04.60]you will hear two long conversations.
[00:07.30]At the end of each conversation,
[00:09.00]you will hear four questions.
[00:11.47]Both the conversation and the questions
[00:13.41]will be spoken only once.
[00:15.88]After you hear a question,
[00:17.32]you must choose the best answer
[00:19.28]from the four choices marked A), B), C) and D).
[00:24.98]Then mark the corresponding letter on Answer Sheet 1
[00:28.13]with a single line through the centre.
[00:31.46]Conversation One
[00:33.62]M: When I say I live in Sweden,
[00:36.22]people always want to know about the seasons.
[00:39.53]W: The seasons?
[00:41.12]M: Yeah, you know how cold it is in winter?
[00:43.63]What it is like when the days are so short?
[00:46.30]W: So what is it like?
[00:48.39]M: Well, it is cold, very cold in winter.
[00:51.65]Sometimes as cold as 26 degrees below centigrade.
[00:55.64]And of course when you go out, you wrap up warm.
[00:59.68]But inside in houses it's always very warm,
[01:04.29]much warmer than at home.
[01:06.45]Swedish people always complain that when they visit England,
[01:10.20]the houses are cold even in a good winter.
[01:13.55]W: And what about the darkness?
[01:15.70]M: Well, yeah, around Christmas time there's only one hour of daylight,
[01:20.04]so you really look forward to the spring. It is sometimes a bit depressing,
[01:24.59]but you see the summers are amazing.
[01:27.09]From May to July in the North of Sweden the sun never sets.
[01:31.75]It's still light at midnight. You can walk in the mountains and read a newspaper.
[01:36.64]W: Oh, yeah, the land of the midnight sun.
[01:40.30]M: That's right, but it's wonderful.
[01:42.76]You wanna stay up all night.
[01:44.71]And the Swedes make the most of it.
[01:46.61]Often they start work earlier in summer
[01:48.75]and then leave at about 2 or 3 in the afternoon,
[01:51.95]so that they can really enjoy the long summer evenings.
[01:55.40]They like to work hard, but play hard, too.
[01:58.94]I think Londoners work longer hours,
[02:01.28]but I'm not sure this is a good thing.
[02:03.88]Questions 8 to 11 are based on the conversation you have just heard.
[02:09.93]8. What do we learn about the man from the conversation?
[02:30.02]9. What do Swedish people complain about
[02:34.27]when they visit England in winter?
[02:51.30]10. How does the man describe the short hour of daylight
[02:56.45]around Christmas in Sweden?
[03:13.36]11. What does the man say about the Swedish people?
[03:33.30]Conversation Two
[03:36.50]W: What kind of training does one need to go into this type of job?
[03:40.11]M: That's a very good question.
[03:41.66]I don't think there is any, specifically.
[03:44.52]W: For example, in your case,
[03:47.12]what was your educational background?
[03:49.40]M: Well, I did a degree in French at Nottingham. After that,
[03:53.50]I did careers work in secondary schools
[03:56.30]like the careers guidance people here in the university.
[03:59.50]Then I went into local government
[04:01.50]because I found I was more interested in the administrative side.
[04:04.95]Then progressed on to universities.
[04:07.45]So there wasn't any plan and there was no specific training.
[04:12.01]There are plenty of training courses in management techniques
[04:15.37]and committee work which you can attend now.
[04:18.58]W: But in the first place, you did a French degree.
[04:21.73]M: In my time, there wasn't a degree you could do for administration.
[04:26.27]I think most of the administrators I've come across
[04:29.39]have degrees and all sorts of things.
[04:32.04]W: Well, I know in my case,
[04:33.98]I did an English literature degree
[04:35.99]and I didn't really expect to end up doing what I am doing now.
[04:39.74]M: Quite.
[04:40.59]W: Were you local to Nottingham, actually?
[04:43.04]Is there any reason why you went to Nottingham University?
[04:46.14]M: No, no, I come from the north of England, from West Yorkshire.
[04:50.28]Nottingham was one of the universities I put on my list.
[04:54.33]And I like the look of it. The campus is just beautiful.
[04:58.24]W: Yes, indeed. Let's see.
[05:00.34]Were you from the industrial part of Yorkshire?
[05:02.93]M: Yes, from the Woolen District.
[05:05.80]Questions 12 to 15 are based on the conversation you have just heard.
[05:13.20]12. What was the man’s major at university?
[05:32.46]13. What was the man’s job in secondary schools?
[05:52.30]14. Where does the man come from?
[06:10.95]15. What attracted the man to Nottingham University?
[06:28.56]
