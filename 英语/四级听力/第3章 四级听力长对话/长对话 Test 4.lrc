[00:01.09]Section B
[00:03.35]Directions: In this section,
[00:06.54]you will hear two long conversations.
[00:10.14]At the end of each conversation,
[00:12.34]you will hear four questions.
[00:14.99]Both the conversation and the questions
[00:18.09]will be spoken only once.
[00:20.96]After you hear a question,
[00:22.92]you must choose the best answer
[00:25.48]from the four choices marked A), B), C) and D).
[00:31.43]Then mark the corresponding letter on Answer Sheet 1
[00:35.63]with a single line through the centre.
[00:39.86]Conversation One
[00:42.66]M: Hi, Shelley. Come on in.
[00:44.11]W: Uh, yeah, I stopped by to see
[00:46.25]if you were still looking for a roommate to share your house.
[00:49.27]M: Yep. I sure am.
[00:50.66]Ever since I cut back on my working hours to go to school,
[00:53.26]I've been really strapped for cash.
[00:54.85]Hey, let me show you around the place.
[00:57.26]Uh, here's the living room.
[00:59.06]W: Oh. It looks like you could use a new carpet...
[01:01.87]and those stains?
[01:03.61]M: Well. I've had a few problems with some former roommates.
[01:07.42]I know it needs to be cleaned,
[01:08.67]but I just don't have the money to do it right now.
[01:11.21]W: Oh. And what about the kitchen?
[01:13.31]M: Right this way. Look.
[01:14.67]It's completely furnished with all the latest appliances, except...
[01:17.82]Well, the refrigerator door is broken... a little bit...
[01:21.57]and it won't shut all the way.
[01:23.22]It needs fixing, but don't worry.
[01:24.86]I've pushed a box against it to keep it shut.
[01:27.22]W: Hmm. Great.
[01:28.81]Well, how about the bathroom? ...
[01:30.76]No, no. Don't tell me.
[01:32.53]The toilet is clogged or the sink has a few leaks.
[01:35.47]M: No, those work fine.
[01:37.22]Well, there's another slight problem.
[01:40.13]The windows.
[01:41.25]I've put up a piece of cardboard to keep out the rain and snow,
[01:43.95]and if it gets a little cold, you can always turn up the heat.
[01:48.17]W: Hey, I think I've seen enough.
[01:50.02]I can't believe you've survived under these conditions.
[01:52.94]M: So what do you think?
[01:54.77]You really can't beat a place like this for $450 a month.
[01:58.01]So it has its problems,
[01:59.72]but we can fix those.
[02:01.06]W: Uh, no, thank you.
[02:02.41]I think I've seen enough.
[02:05.22]Questions 8 to 11 are based on the conversation you have just heard.
[02:12.95]8. Why does the man need to share his apartment with a roommate?
[02:34.72]9. What is true about the man’s house?
[02:53.87]10. What has the man done to temporarily fix the refrigerator door?
[03:14.71]11. What will Shelley probably do after she’s seen the place?
[03:35.32]Conversation Two
[03:37.78]W: Now I've got your background,
[03:39.17]let's talk about the management trainee scheme.
[03:41.97]What exactly do you think a manager does?
[03:44.51]M: I don't know a great deal about the work.
[03:47.10]W: But have you got any ideas about it?
[03:49.55]You must have thought about it.
[03:51.47]M: Well, er, I suppose he has a lot of, er,
[03:53.92]what is called, policy-making to do.
[03:57.01]And, mm, he'd have to know
[03:59.38]how to work with people and all about the company.
[04:01.87]W: Mmm.
[04:03.26]M: Yes, I, er, should think a manager must know,
[04:06.71]er, something about all aspects of the work.
[04:09.91]W: Yes, that's right.
[04:11.00]We like our executive staff to undergo a thorough training.
[04:14.71]Young men on our trainee scheme have to work
[04:17.16]through every branch in the company.
[04:19.68]M: Well, if I had to do it, I suppose.
[04:22.49]But I was thinking that my French and German would mean
[04:24.68]that I could specialize in overseas work.
[04:26.63]I'd like to be some sort of an export salesman and travel abroad.
[04:30.69]W: You know the charm of traveling abroad disappears
[04:33.83]when you've got to work hard.
[04:35.21]It's not all fun and game.
[04:37.33]M: Oh, yes, I realize that.
[04:39.27]It's just that my knowledge of languages would be useful.
[04:42.26]W: Now, Mr. Smith,
[04:43.27]is there anything you want to ask me?
[04:45.56]M: Well, there's one or two things.
[04:48.01]I'd like to know if I'd have to sign a contract,
[04:50.16]what the salary is and what the prospects are.
[04:52.81]W: With our scheme,
[04:53.65]Mr. Smith, there is no contract involved.
[04:56.29]Your progress is kept under constant review.
[04:59.10]If we, at any time, decide we don't like you,
[05:02.46]then that's that! We reserve the right to dismiss you.
[05:06.01]Of course, you have the same choice about us.
[05:09.66]As for salary, you'd be on our fixed scale starting at 870 pounds.
[05:14.92]For the successful trainee,
[05:16.92]the prospects are very good.
[05:20.21]Questions 12 to 15 are based on the conversation you have just heard.
[05:28.78]12. How does Mr. Smith sound when asked what a manager’s role is?
[05:49.07]13. What does the man think is his advantage of working overseas?
[06:09.88]14. What does Mr. Smith say he would like to be?
[06:29.71]15. What is true about the management trainee scheme?
[06:47.33]
