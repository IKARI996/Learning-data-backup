[00:01.09]Section B
[00:03.35]Directions: In this section,
[00:06.54]you will hear two long conversations.
[00:10.14]At the end of each conversation,
[00:12.34]you will hear four questions.
[00:14.99]Both the conversation and the questions
[00:18.09]will be spoken only once.
[00:20.96]After you hear a question,
[00:22.92]you must choose the best answer
[00:25.48]from the four choices marked A), B), C) and D).
[00:31.43]Then mark the corresponding letter on Answer Sheet 1
[00:35.63]with a single line through the centre.
[00:40.11]Conversation One
[00:42.67]W: What sort of hours do you work, Steve?
[00:45.59]M: Well, I have to work very long hours, about 11 hours a day.
[00:50.51]W: What time do you start?
[00:52.51]M: I work 9 to 3.
[00:54.86]Then I start again at 5:30 and work until 11.
[00:58.88]Six days a week.
[01:00.53]So I have to work very unsocial hours.
[01:04.08]W: And do you have to work at the weekend?
[01:06.49]M: Oh, yes, that's our busiest time.
[01:09.11]I get Wednesdays off.
[01:11.67]W: What are the things you have to do,
[01:13.66]and the things you don't have to do?
[01:16.16]M: Eh, I don't have to do the washing-up, so that's good.
[01:20.37]I have to wear white
[01:22.38]and I have to keep everything in the kitchen totally clean.
[01:26.12]W: What's hard about the job?
[01:28.53]M: You're standing up all the time.
[01:31.34]When we're busy, people get angry and sharp.
[01:34.75]But that's normal.
[01:36.80]W: How did you learn the profession?
[01:39.17]M: Well, I did a two-year course at college.
[01:42.66]In the first year, we had to learn the basics.
[01:45.72]And then we had to take exams.
[01:47.96]W: Was it easy to find a job?
[01:50.37]M: I wrote to about six hotels.
[01:53.07]And one of them gave me my first job.
[01:55.51]So I didn't have to wait too long.
[01:57.76]W: And what's the secret of being good at your job?
[02:02.10]M: Attention to detail. You have to love it.
[02:05.94]You have to show passion for it.
[02:08.14]W: And what are your plans for the future?
[02:11.49]M: I want to have my own place when the time is right.
[02:16.14]Questions 8 to 11 are based on the conversation you have just heard.
[02:24.01]8. What does the man say about his job?
[02:43.19]9. What does the man think is the hardest part of his job?
[03:03.83]10. Where did the man get his first job after graduation?
[03:24.78]11. What does the man say is important to being good at his job?
[03:46.25]Conversation Two
[03:50.75]W: Now you've seen this table of figures
[03:53.42]about the pocket money children in Britain get?
[03:56.76]M: Yes. I thought it was quite interesting,
[04:00.23]but I don't quite understand the column entitled "Change".
[04:04.77]Can you explain what it means?
[04:06.88]W: Well, I think it means the change from the year before.
[04:11.69]I am not a mathematician,
[04:14.03]but I assume the rise from 72p to 90p
[04:18.79]is a rise of 25 percent.
[04:21.93]M: Oh, yes. I see.
[04:23.82]And the inflation rate is there for comparison.
[04:26.82]W: Yes. Why do you think the rise in pocket money
[04:30.58]is often higher than inflation?
[04:32.93]M: I am sorry I've no idea.
[04:35.59]Perhaps parents in Britain are too generous.
[04:38.83]W: Perhaps they are.
[04:40.54]But it looks as if children were not better off in 2001
[04:45.63]than they were in 2002.
[04:48.64]That's strange, isn't it?
[04:50.49]And they seem to have been better off in 2003
[04:54.44]than they are now.
[04:56.28]I wonder why that is.
[04:58.35]M: Yes. I don't understand that at all.
[05:01.40]W: Anyway, if you had children,
[05:04.39]how much pocket money would you give them?
[05:07.44]M: I don't know.
[05:08.98]I think I'll probably give them 2 pounds a week.
[05:13.53]W: Would you?
[05:14.73]And what would you expect them to do with it?
[05:17.83]M: Well, out of that,
[05:19.63]they'd have to buy some small personal things,
[05:22.18]but I wouldn't expect them
[05:23.68]to save to buy their own socks, for example.
[05:26.27]W: Yes. By the way,
[05:28.52]do most children in your country get pocket money?
[05:32.33]M: Yeah, they do.
[05:35.03]Questions 12 to 15 are based on the conversation you have just heard.
[05:42.45]12. What is the table of figures about?
[06:01.05]13. What do we learn from the conversation
[06:05.54]about British children’s pocket money?
[06:22.74]14. Why does the man think
[06:26.39]the rise in pocket money is often higher than inflation?
[06:44.80]15. Supposing the man had children,
[06:49.19]what would he expect them to do with their pocket money?
[07:04.42]
