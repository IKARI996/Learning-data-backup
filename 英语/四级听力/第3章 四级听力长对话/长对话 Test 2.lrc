[00:01.09]Section B
[00:03.35]Directions: In this section,
[00:06.54]you will hear two long conversations.
[00:10.14]At the end of each conversation,
[00:12.34]you will hear four questions.
[00:14.99]Both the conversation and the questions
[00:18.09]will be spoken only once.
[00:20.96]After you hear a question,
[00:22.92]you must choose the best answer
[00:25.48]from the four choices marked A), B), C) and D).
[00:31.43]Then mark the corresponding letter on Answer Sheet 1
[00:35.63]with a single line through the centre.
[00:39.70]Conversation One
[00:42.97]W: Hey Neal,
[00:43.99]now that the midterms are over a bunch of us
[00:46.52]are getting away for the weekend to go canoeing.
[00:49.62]You want to come along?
[00:50.97]M: Well, uhm, it'd be great to get away,
[00:53.48]but I've never done it before.
[00:56.04]W: None of the others have either except for me.
[00:59.08]I went once last fall.
[01:00.88]But there'll be an instructor in each canoe the first day.
[01:04.29]M: I don't know.
[01:05.38]W: Oh, come on.
[01:06.32]This is our last chance to take a break before finals.
[01:09.74]The scenery is beautiful,
[01:11.48]and if it gets too hot we can dive in whenever we feel like it.
[01:15.29]The river's really calm this time of the year,
[01:17.93]no rapids to deal with.
[01:19.88]M: That's a relief.
[01:21.14]What would I have to bring?
[01:22.61]W: Let's see.
[01:24.04]Tom's bringing food for the Friday night cookout for everyone.
[01:27.73]And the people who run the trip have tents set up
[01:30.62]and they supply food and drinks for all day Saturday.
[01:34.00]On the way back Sunday morning we'll stop somewhere for breakfast.
[01:38.59]So, you have to bring a bathing suit and a sleeping bag.
[01:42.56]M: Well, I do love camping and sleeping out.
[01:45.00]Where is this place?
[01:46.60]W: Well, it's about an hour and a half to the place
[01:49.26]where we meet the trip leaders.
[01:51.31]We leave our car there and they drive us
[01:54.15]and the canoes upriver to the place where we start canoeing.
[01:57.66]M: And who's driving us to the meeting place?
[02:00.11]W: Well, I was hoping we could take your car.
[02:03.08]Mine's in the shop again.
[02:04.63]M: Oh, I see.
[02:05.74]It's not me you want, it's my car.
[02:07.84]W: Don't be silly.
[02:09.09]So what would you say?
[02:10.85]M: Oh, why not!
[02:12.69]W: Great! I'll give you a call
[02:14.44]when I find out when everyone wants to leave on Friday.
[02:19.01]Questions 8 to 11 are based on the conversation you have just heard.
[02:26.21]8. What is the main reason the woman calls the man?
[02:46.16]9. What is one of the attractions
[02:49.78]the woman tells the man about canoeing?
[03:07.36]10. What is one thing the man has to bring?
[03:26.88]11. What will the woman confirm with the man soon?
[03:46.61]Conversation Two
[03:49.75]M: How do you like the new art museum?
[03:51.90]W: Wonderful! I spent most of my time at the art museum.
[03:56.25]I especially liked the new wing.
[03:58.32]I was amazed to hear the guide explain the problems they had building it.
[04:02.51]M: Right. I just read an article that went on and on about the cost.
[04:06.34]90 million in total I think.
[04:08.34]W: Yeah. The guide mentioned that.
[04:10.18]You could see they spared no expense.
[04:12.45]M: Hm. It looked really unusual,
[04:14.90]at least from what I saw in the picture.
[04:16.85]W: It is. The basic design is two triangles.
[04:20.85]In fact there are triangles all over,
[04:23.27]the paving stones in the courtyard,
[04:25.48]the skylights and even a lot of the sculptures.
[04:28.97]One sculpture is a mobile.
[04:30.88]It's in the courtyard and it's made of pieces of aluminum
[04:33.89]that moves slowly in the air.
[04:36.20]It's really impressive.
[04:38.30]M: That was in the article too.
[04:39.89]It said that the original was steel
[04:41.56]and it weighed so much that it wasn't safe to hand.
[04:44.46]W: Right. They did it over in aluminum
[04:46.80]so it wouldn't come crashing down on someone's head.
[04:49.92]M: You know the article went into that in detail.
[04:53.07]There was even an interview with the sculptor.
[04:55.08]W: I'd like to read that.
[04:56.49]Would you mind if I borrow the magazine sometime?
[04:59.15]M: No. I wouldn't mind if I haven't thrown it out yet.
[05:03.72]Questions 12 to 15 are based on the conversation you have just heard.
[05:11.28]12. How had the man learned about the museum?
[05:30.58]13. According to the woman,
[05:34.54]what do the paving stones and skylights have in common?
[05:52.74]14. What was the problem with the original mobile?
[06:12.47]15. Why wouldn’t the mobile crash down on someone’s head?
[06:31.69]
